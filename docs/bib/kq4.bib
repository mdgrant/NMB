@article{Cashman1990,
	abstract = {The characteristics of neuromuscular block induced by doxacurium were compared in patients with and without renal function. Seventeen patients with end stage chronic renal failure and 18 patients with normal renal function were anaesthetized with 0.5{\%} halothane and nitrous oxide in oxygen and received doxacurium in an initial dose of 25 micrograms kg-1 (estimated from available data as an ED95 dose), with incremental doses of 5 micrograms kg-1. At the end of surgery, residual neuromuscular block was antagonized with either edrophonium 1.0 mg kg-1 or neostigmine 0.08 mg kg-1. There was no significant difference between the mean maximum blocks achieved with doxacurium: 17.4{\%} (renal failure group) and 11.6{\%} (control group) of control twitch heights, or between the mean times to achieve maximum block (10.9 min and 10.8 min, respectively). The mean duration of action of doxacurium, indicated by the time for twitch height to recover to 25{\%} of control, was longer in the renal failure group (120.8 min vs 66.7 min in the control group) (ns). Similarly, the mean duration of action of increments was longer in the renal failure group (27.4 min vs 20.5 min in the control group). The rate of spontaneous recovery from doxacurium as indicated by the time for twitch height to recover from 0 to 5{\%}, 5 to 10{\%} and 10 to 25{\%}, was not significantly different in the two groups. Antagonism of doxacurium was achieved more reliably with neostigmine than with edrophonium in both groups. The administration of doxacurium was associated with minimal cardiovascular effects.},

@article{Magorian1990,
	abstract = {The authors sought to determine whether neostigmine, given at a time when no response to peripheral nerve stimulation could be elicited, hastened recovery from a vecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade (NMB). The effect of neostigmine (70 micrograms/kg) in antagonizing a profound (no-twitch) vecuronium-induced (0.1 mg/kg) NMB in 40 healthy patients was studied. Patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups specifying the sequence of neostigmine administration. Fifteen minutes after the administration of vecuronium, when there was no detectable twitch response, each patient received either neostigmine (70 micrograms/kg) with glycopyrrolate (15 micrograms/kg) or an equivalent volume of normal saline (placebo). When T1 (the first response in the train-of-four {$[$}TOF{$]$} sequence) recovered to 10{\%} of control, patients again received either neostigmine with glycopyrrolate in the same doses as before or the placebo. The following variables were measured: times from vecuronium injection until T1 recovered to 10{\%} (t {$[$}10{$]$}) and 90{\%} (t {$[$}90{$]$}) of control, and time until the TOF ratio was equal to 75{\%} (t {$[$}TOF75{$]$}). Mean values of t (90) and t (TOF75) were shorter (54.7-75.2 min and 60.4-79.5 min, respectively) for the three groups who received neostigmine as compared with patients who received two doses of placebo (104.3 and 122.6 min, respectively). There were no differences in the t (90) and t (TOF75) values among the three groups who received neostigmine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	abstract = {Neostigmine 0.06 mg.kg-1 or edrophonium 1 mg.kg-1 were administered to two groups of 15 patients each for antagonism of pipecuronium-induced neuromuscular block at 20{\%} spontaneous recovery of the first twitch (T1) of the train-of-four (TOF) stimulation. The mean onset of action (+/-SEM) of edrophonium (18.1 +/- 2.4 sec) was significantly more rapid (P less than 0.01) than that of neostigmine (47.6 +/- 4 sec), as were the times taken to attain a TOF ratio of 0.25 and 0.5. Nevertheless, the reversal time (time taken from the end of injection of the antagonist until TOF ratio value had reached 0.75) was significantly shorter (P less than 0.01) in the neostigmine than in the edrophonium group (499.3 +/- 62 vs 767 +/- 52 sec respectively). The TOF ratio ten minutes after reversal was greater in the neostigmine group than in the edrophonium group (P less than 0.01), 0.78 +/- 0.02 vs 0.68 +/- 0.02 min respectively. At that time, 33{\%} (5 out of 15) and 80{\%} (12 out of 15) patients failed to be reversed adequately (TOF ratio of 0.75) after neostigmine 0.06 mg.kg-1 and edrophonium 1 mg.kg-1, respectively. Administration of one additional dose (one-third of the initial dose) of the same antagonist resulted in adequate antagonism in the remaining five patients in the neostigmine group and in nine patients in the edrophonium group. Two such doses were required in the remaining three patients in the latter group. The mean total dose of neostigmine and edrophonium employed in this study was 0.067 +/- 0.002 and 1.3 +/- 0.05 mg.kg-1, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

For comparison with normal practice, a fifth group received neostigmine 0.05 mg kg-1 when the first twitch of the train-of-four was 10{\%} of control. Total recovery time from PTC1 10{\%} to a train-of-four ratio of 0.8 was not reduced by early administration of the anticholinesterases, compared with conventional administration of neostigmine at T1 10{\%}. However, recovery from intense block was faster after neostigmine than edrophonium (P less than 0.01). Doubling the doses of the anticholinesterases did not reduce the recovery time and had the effect of increasing variability. We conclude that there is no clinical advantage in attempting to antagonize intense neuromuscular block in children using normal or increased doses of neostigmine or edrophonium.},

When the first EMG response (T1) of the train-of-four had recovered to 5{\%} of control (T0), an infusion of mivacurium 10 micrograms kg-1 min-1 was started and adjusted to keep T1 at 5{\%}. Ten patients in each group were given neostigmine 35 micrograms kg-1 when the infusion was stopped when T1/T0 had recovered to 20{\%}; in the others recovery was spontaneous. After the bolus dose of mivacurium, mean (SD) depression of T1 was greater in the anephric group than in the normal group (98.4 (3.5) vs 96.8 (4.4){\%}; P less than 0.01) and recovery of T1/T0 to 5{\%} was slower (15.3 (6.9) vs 9.8 (3.5) min; P less than 0.01). Anephric patients required a slower infusion rate (6.3 (1.9) vs 10.4 (2.8) micrograms kg-1 min-1; P less than 0.001). Neostigmine hastened recovery of both T1/T0 and T4/T1 in both groups. Spontaneous recovery of T1/T0 (from 25{\%} to 75{\%}) after the infusion was also slower in anephric patients (12.2 (8.2) vs 7.7 (1.2) min; P less than 0.05). Plasma cholinesterase activity was less in the anephric group (785 (207) vs 943 (217) iu litre-1; P less than 0.05) and there was a (negative) correlation overall between cholinesterase activity and time to 5{\%} recovery of T1/T0 after the bolus dose (r = -0.42; P less than 0.02).

We have compared the antagonist characteristics of these two drugs when used to antagonize a moderate degree of pancuronium- or tubocurarine-induced neuromuscular block. Forty ASA I or II patients undergoing surgical procedures were allocated randomly to receive either pancuronium 70 micrograms kg-1 or tubocurarine 0.5 mg kg-1, and to receive either edrophonium 0.5 mg kg-1 or neostigmine 0.05 mg kg-1. Antagonism was attempted when the first response to train-of-four (TOF) stimulation recovered spontaneously to 25{\%} of the control height. Neuromuscular function was monitored using the evoked integrated electromyogram of the first dorsal interosseous muscle of the hand. Adequate recovery was defined as the achievement of a TOF ratio of 0.70 or greater. Only seven of 20 patients who received edrophonium demonstrated adequate recovery 30 min after antagonism. Under the conditions described in this study, edrophonium 0.5 mg kg-1 was less effective as an antagonist than neostigmine 0.05 mg kg-1.},

	abstract = {The use of rocuronium (Org 9426) as a single bolus followed by an infusion was assessed in 50 patients under anaesthesia with nitrous oxide-oxygen and halothane. Neuromuscular block was monitored using train-of-four stimulation and recording the force of contraction of the adductor pollicis muscle. Rocuronium was administered in an initial bolus dose of 0.45 mg.kg-1 followed by an infusion adjusted manually to maintain the T1, the first response in the train-of-four, at 10{\%} of control. Following cessation of rocuronium infusion the patients were either allowed to recover spontaneously (n = 10) or were given neostigmine 50 micrograms.kg-1 or edrophonium 1 mg.kg-1 at 10 or 25{\%} recovery of the T1 (n = 10 for each group). Adequate antagonism was defined as attaining a sustained train-of-four ratio of 0.7. Rocuronium requirements showed marked variation among individual patients but were relatively constant in individual patients. The mean (SD) time to attain stable infusion rates was 17.4 (10.9) min. The mean (SD) requirement of rocuronium for steady state 90{\%} block of T1 was 572 (190) micrograms.kg-1.h-1 (range 242-1104 micrograms.kg-1.h-1). The mean (SD) time to attain a train-of-four ratio of 0.7 in the group allowed to recover spontaneously was 36.1 (7.3) min. This interval was 7.5 (1.9), 9.3 (7.0), 4.6 (1.9) and 1.9 (0.9) min respectively in the groups receiving neostigmine at T1 of 10{\%}, edrophonium at T1 of 10{\%}, neostigmine at T1 of 25{\%} and edrophonium at T1 of 25{\%}. The antagonism was significantly faster in those reversed at 25{\%} (p < 0.05). Three patients in the group receiving edrophonium at T1 of 10{\%} and one in the group receiving neostigmine at T1 of 25{\%} failed to attain a train-of-four ratio of 0.7. It is concluded that rocuronium can be administered as a continuous infusion for stable neuromuscular block. Neostigmine may be a more reliable antagonist of deep block, whereas edrophonium is advantageous when there is a greater spontaneous recovery.},

There are few studies about antagonism of very weak residual NMB. Therefore we compared hemodynamic stability, train-of-four (TOF) characteristics and reversal time (time from administration of antagonists to train-of-four-ratio (TR) at least 0.70) of EDR 0.5 mg kg-1 + atropine (ATR) 0.007 mg kg-1 to NST 0.04 mg kg-1 + glycopyrrolate (GLY) 0.008 mg kg-1 when they were used to antagonize a residual vecuronium (VEC)-induced NMB (T1 25-75{\%}). The NMB was monitored in 64 patients using the evoked electromyogram of the hypothenar muscle of the hand. An adequate antagonism was defined as a TR of 0.70 or higher. Heart rate was significantly higher in NST+GLY group 2 min after administration of the antagonists in comparison with the EDR+ATR group. The advantages of EDR (higher T1, TR and percentage of patients with an adequate recovery) were obvious during the first 5 min of reversal time. Therefore we conclude, that under the conditions described in the present study, EDR antagonizes residual VEC induced NMB faster than NST.},

The antagonist was injected at a deep level of the block (T1{\%} = 1{\%}-8{\%}) and neuromuscular (NM) recovery was evaluated by train-of-four twitches (TOF). T1{\%} was used during maintenance, whereas both T1{\%} and TOF{\%} (fourth response/first response x 100) were used during recovery. Investigators were blinded to the antagonist used. Plasma cholinesterase activity was measured prior to antagonist administration (0 min), as well as 15, 30, and 60 min after. Plasma cholinesterase activity was decreased to 29{\%} of control at 15 min and remained at approximately 60{\%} of the control after neostigmine administration. Edrophonium did not affect plasma cholinesterase activity. Clinically adequate spontaneous recovery (TOF{\%} > or = 70{\%}) of the mivacurium block with placebo required 15-18 min. On average, clinically adequate antagonism of mivacurium by edrophonium was 50{\%} faster than placebo and 30{\%}-40{\%} faster than with neostigmine. In summary, the speed of antagonism with edrophonium is faster than with neostigmine when antagonizing deep mivacurium NM block.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	abstract = {We have compared the antagonism of neuromuscular block produced by pipecuronium with pancuronium in 80 anaesthetized surgical patients using mechanomyography and electromyography. Pancuronium 0.1 mg kg-1 or pipecuronium 0.07 mg kg-1 was given after induction of anaesthesia and neuromuscular block was adjusted to 75{\%} twitch depression at the time of antagonism. The following regimens were used: edrophonium 0.5 and 1.0 mg kg-1, neostigmine 0.04 mg kg-1, pyridostigmine 0.3 mg kg-1 and edrophonium 0.25 mg kg-1 with pyridostigmine 0.15 mg kg-1. Antagonism was evaluated also by the head lift test. There was no difference between the reversibility of neuromuscular block produced by pancuronium or pipecuronium. Edrophonium produced a significantly faster antagonism than neostigmine or pyridostigmine but onset of action was not significantly faster than that of edrophonium with pyridostigmine. All regimens produced 100{\%} (or near 100{\%}) antagonism of twitch response within 15 min. However, TOF fade antagonism was more complete with pyridostigmine, neostigmine and edrophonium 1.0 mg kg-1 than with edrophonium 0.5 mg kg-1. The head lift test indicated somewhat less antagonism with edrophonium 0.5 and 1.0 mg kg-1. Using five monitoring methods, the rank order of reversal potency was: pyridostigmine approximately neostigmine > edrophonium 1.0 mg kg-1 > edrophonium+pyridostigmine > edrophonium 0.5 mg kg-1.},

The patients were divided into five age groups: 0-2 months, 3-11 months, 2-5 years, 6-10 years, and 11-15 years. At the end of surgery, the neuromuscular block was randomly antagonized with either neostigmine 50 micrograms kg-1 with atropine 20 micrograms kg-1 or with edrophonium 1 mg kg-1 with atropine 10 micrograms kg-1. In general, the first EMG response and train-of-four (TOF) ratio recovered fastest in the youngest age groups following either reversal agent (P < 0.05). However, in each age group edrophonium had a faster onset of effect than neostigmine (P < 0.05) even though a greater TAO-ratio was finally reached with neostigmine. The effects of neostigmine were less variable and more predictable than those of edrophonium. Therefore, we recommend the use of neostigmine for routine paediatric practice.},

Seventy-five ASA I or II adults were given mivarcurium 0.15 mg x kg(-1) followed by an infusion (7 micrograms x kg(-1) x min(-1) during alfentanil-propofol-N2O-enflurane anaesthesia. Train-of-four stimulation (TOF) was applied to the ulnar nerve every 20 sec and the response of the adductor policis was recorded (Relaxograph NMT-100, Datex, Helsinki, Finland). Mivacurium infusion was modified at five-minute intervals in order to keep the height of the first twitch in TOF(T1) at 5{\%} of its control value. At the end of surgery, edrophonium (0.0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, or 1.0 mg x kg(-1) combined glycopyrrolate (0.0, 0.0012, 0.0025, 0.005, or 0.01 mg x kg(-1) were administered by random allocation. Edrophonium doses of 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg x kg(-1) were different from placebo with regard to time to attain a TOF ratio (fourth twitch in TOF/T1) = 0.7 (13.8 +/- 4.5, 11.1 +/- 3.5, 11.4 +/- 3.0 vs 19.7 +/- 4.7 min P< 0.05). Doses of 0.5 and 1.0 mg x kg(-1) permitted faster recovery time of T1 from 10 to 95{\%} (T10-95) than did placebo (7.5 +/- 3.8, 8.9 +/- 3.5 vs 14.5 +/- 5.0 min P<0.05). Edrophonium 0.5 mg x kg(-1) was different from placebo with regard to recovery time of T1 from 25 to 75{\%} (T25-75) (3.3 +/- 2.0 vs 6.7 +/- 2.0 min P<0.05). Only edrophonium 0.5 mg x kg(-1) provided faster recovery than placebo with regard to all three indices. It is concluded that edrophonium 0.5 + glycopyrrolate 0.005 mg x kg(-1) allow the fastest recovery from a mivacurium-induced block during enflurane-N2O anaesthesia.},

@article{Miller1995,
	abstract = {Mivacurium is a new non-depolarizing muscle relaxant consisting of three stereoisomers. The two active isomers (cis-trans and trans-trans) undergo rapid metabolism by plasma cholinesterase (t1/2 beta < 2 min). Due to its rapid elimination, the need for reversal of mivacurium-induced neuromuscular block is controversial, and to date there have been no studies evaluating reversal of deep blocks. The object of the current investigation was to establish the lowest effective dose of edrophonium required to reverse deep mivacurium-induced neuromuscular block. One hundred ASA Class I and II patients undergoing outpatient surgery in two teaching institutions were studied in this randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind trial. Under balanced propofol/nitrous oxide/alfentanil anaesthesia, a continuous infusion of mivacurium was adjusted to maintain between 5-10{\%} of control T1 amplitude. Upon completion of surgery, neuromuscular block was reversed by injecting normal saline (Group PLAC), edrophonium 0.125 mg.kg-1 (Group EDR-1), 0.25 mg.kg-1 (Group EDR-2), or 0.50 mg.kg-1 (Group EDR-3), in addition to a corresponding dose of atropine. Spontaneous recovery, from a T1 response of < 10{\%} to a TOF ratio > or = 0.7, required 13.5 +/- 2.6 min (PLAC Group). In comparison, patients in the EDR-1 group required 9.2 +/- 2.6 min (P < 0.01). Higher doses of edrophonium conferred no advantage. Four patients (4{\%}) had not achieved a TOF ratio of > or = 70{\%}, 20 min after reversal, and required additional edrophonium. Two patients (PLAC group), had dibucaine numbers and cholinesterase levels consistent with an EUEA genotype, whereas the two patients with delayed recovery in the EDR-1 group had characteristics of a normal genotype. We conclude that a very low dose of edrophonium (0.125 mg.kg-1) hastens reversal of deep mivacurium-induced neuromuscular block by approximately four minutes, and that edrophonium doses exceeding 0.125 mg.kg-1 provide no additional benefit. Heterozygous patients with atypical plasma cholinesterase levels, as well as certain individuals with normal dibucaine numbers and plasma cholinesterase activity, are at risk for prolonged neuromuscular block, but the block is easily reversed with edrophonium.},

	abstract = {The effectiveness of neostigmine 40 micrograms/kg for antagonism of two different levels of neuromuscular blockade, induced by a bolus dose of mivacurium 0.15 mg/kg, was studied in 45 patients. The patients were anaesthetized with thiopentone, fentanyl, nitrous oxide in oxygen, and enflurane. Neostigmine was administered at either 10{\%} recovery of the twitch height (TH10) at the adductor pollicis muscle (n = 14) or upon reappearance of the first response at the orbicularis oculi muscle (OO1) after train-of-four (TOF) stimulation (n = 16), the latter representing a deeper degree of neuromuscular blockade. Fifteen of the 45 patients did not receive neostigmine (control group). Neostigmine administration at OO1 rather than at TH10 at the adductor pollicis muscle caused reversal of neuromuscular blockade to occur 8 min earlier and shortened the time to reach 25{\%} recovery of the twitch height (TH25) at the adductor pollicis muscle by about 5 min, compared with the control group. However, the time needed to reach a T4/T1 ratio > or = 0.8 was similar in both the early and late neostigmine administration groups, being 9 min faster than in the control group. It can be concluded that there is no advantage in administering neostigmine at profound neuromuscular blockade to achieve clinically adequate recovery (T4/T1 ratio > or = 0.8). However, the time between injection of mivacurium and TH25 may be shortened by using neostigmine at profound neuromuscular blockade, a procedure which may be useful in case of unpredictably difficult intubation, since diaphragmatic movements usually reappear at TH25.},

	abstract = {The routine use of cholinesterase inhibitors to antagonize residual neuromuscular block may be associated with increased postoperative emesis. Rapid spontaneous recovery from mivacurium may obviate the need for these drugs. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 113 healthy children who had received mivacurium as part of a standardized anesthetic regimen, we compared the incidence of postoperative complications after spontaneous recovery and after the use of neostigmine-glycopyrrolate or edrophonium-atropine. The anesthetic regimen consisted of halothane, nitrous oxide, fentanyl, 2 micrograms/kg intravenous (i.v.), mivacurium in an initial dose of 0.2 mg/kg, followed by an infusion, adjusted to maintain > or = 1 evoked contraction response to a supramaximum train-of-four stimulus. At the end of the procedure, patients received by random assignment one of three drug combinations: 1) neostigmine 70 micrograms/kg + glycopyrrolate 10 micrograms/kg, i.v., 2) edrophonium 1 mg/kg + atropine 10 micrograms/kg, i.v., and 3) saline. The trachea was extubated when evoked responses to peripheral nerve stimulation and clinical signs of adequate neuromuscular recovery were present. Postoperative pain was treated with morphine and emesis with metoclopramide. There were no significant differences between the three groups with respect to age, surgery, intraoperative fentanyl, and mivacurium use, time from the end of surgery to tracheal extubation, postanesthesia care unit (PACU) arrival and discharge, or in postoperative oxygen saturation values and analgesic requirements. Compared to the placebo group, emesis occurred more often in the PACU in patients receiving the neostigmine-glycopyrrolate combination, but not after edrophonium-atropine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	abstract = {Dose-response relationships for the antagonism of intermediate-acting neuromuscular blocking agents have not been evaluated previously in children. We have examined the dose-response relationships for neostigmine antagonism of 90{\%} rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block in children and adults, during nitrous oxide-1 MAC of isoflurane anaesthesia. We studied 40 children, aged 2-10 yr, and 50 adults, aged 18-60 yr; all received a single bolus dose of rocuronium 0.6 mg kg-1 and accelerometry was used to monitor neuromuscular transmission. When the first twitch of the train-of-four (TOF) response (T1) recovered to 10{\%} of its control (T0), one of five doses of neostigmine 0, 5, 10, 20 or 50 micrograms kg-1 was given by random allocation to each of the study groups (n = 8 children and n = 10 adults). Recovery of T1 and TOF ratio (T4/T1{\%}) was recorded for 10 min after initial administration of neostigmine. Onset time of rocuronium-induced block was faster in children than in adults (mean 64.6 (95{\%} confidence intervals 57.7-71.5) s vs 83.7 (70.7-96.6) s; P < 0.05). The time to 10{\%} recovery of T1/T0 was shorter in children than in adults (25.4 (22.9-27.9) min vs 38.8 (36.1-41.4) min; P < 0.001). Spontaneous and antagonist-assisted recovery were more rapid in children than in adults. Adequate recovery (T4/T1 of 80{\%}) occurred in children at 4, 5 and 8 min after neostigmine 50, 20 and 10 micrograms kg-1, respectively. Adequate recovery was not produced in adults by any dose of neostigmine within 10 min. The effective doses of neostigmine required to achieve a TOF ratio of 80{\%} (ED80) after 10 min in children and adults were, respectively, 7.10 (5.2-9.8) micrograms kg-1 and 56.56 (45.5-71.9) micrograms kg-1 (P < 0.001). There was no advantage in administering doses of neostigmine greater than 20 micrograms kg-1 to antagonize 90{\%} rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block in children. In contrast, it appeared prudent to use neostigmine 50 micrograms kg-1 or more for adequate antagonism of a similar degree of block in adults.},

	abstract = {We studied the possible effects of repetitive (1-min interval) 50- and 100-Hz tetanic stimuli on 50-Hz and 100-Hz tetanic fade ratios (RF50HZ and RF100HZ). We also evaluated the sensitivity of the recorded responses to these two tests to assess residual neuromuscular block (isometric adductor pollicis mechanical activity), either during spontaneous recovery, or 15 min after neostigmine administration, in 22 adult anesthetized (thiopental, fentanyl, N2O/O2) patients receiving vecuronium. Two 50-Hz and two 100-Hz, 5-s duration, tetanic stimulations were randomly assessed at 1-min intervals: in a spontaneous (SPO) group (n = 11), when train-of-four (TOF) ratio spontaneously regained 0.7, and in a neostigmine (NEO) group (n = 11), 15 min after 40 micrograms/kg neostigmine was given intravenously at 25{\%} return of control twitch tension. In the SPO group, when TOF ratio was 0.7, RF50HZ was 0.92 +/- 0.01 before and after subsequent tetanic stimulation, while RF100HZ was 0.48 +/- 0.05 and 0.47 +/- 0.05, respectively (not significant {$[$}NS{$]$}). In the NEO group, when TOF ratio was approximately 0.9, RF50HZ was 0.93 +/- 0.01 before and after subsequent tetanic stimulation, while RF100HZ was 0.80 +/- 0.02 and 0.78 +/- 0.02, respectively (NS). From patient to patient, both RF50HZ and RF100HZ were also identical. In conclusion, in patients receiving vecuronium, 1) 5-s, 50- and 100-Hz tetanic stimuli may be repeated without changes at 1-min intervals and, 2) in contrast to RF50HZ, recorded RF100HZ enables one to determine residual neuromuscular block during spontaneous recovery (P < 0.001) such as after neostigmine reversal (P < 0.05).},

	abstract = {Neostigmine antagonism after suxamethonium followed by mivacurium chloride bolus and infusion was studied. Thirty ASA group I or II patients were given mivacurium 0.15 mg/kg followed by infusion during nitrous oxide-enflurane-pethidine anaesthesia. Train of four (TOF) stimuli were applied to the ulnar nerve at the wrist and TOF twitch height and ratio measured by TOF-GUARD nerve stimulator. Mivacurium infusion was titrated to give a 90{\%} block of first twitch height. Patients were randomized into two groups. Group I patients recovered from the mivacurium block spontaneously while Group II patients were given neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and atropine 0.02 mg/kg. Time to reach train of four ratio (TOFR) of 25{\%}, 50{\%} and 70{\%} were measured. This study demonstrated a mean infusion rate of 5.1 +/- 1.8 micrograms/kg/min to maintain a 90{\%} neuromuscular block. In the spontaneous recovery group, time to reach TOFR of 25{\%}, 50{\%} and 70{\%} were 9.3 +/- 2.7 min, 13.5 +/- 3.0 min and 16.7 +/- 3.0 min respectively while the corresponding times in the neostigmine group were 5.2 +/- 1.7 min, 10.9 +/- 2.2 min and 16.1 +/- 7.4 min respectively. There were significant differences in the time taken to TOFR of 25{\%} (P < 0.0001) and 50{\%} (P < 0.05) but no difference in the time taken for TOFR to return to 70{\%}. We concluded that mivacurium is suitable for use in caesarean section despite a decrease in plasma cholinesterase activity. Neostigmine antagonism is not required as a routine.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Mivacurium is metabolized by plasma cholinesterase catalyzed ester hydrolysis. Acetylcholinesterase antagonists used in the reversal of muscle relaxation may also inhibit plasma cholinesterase and, therefore, delay the hydrolysis of mivacurium. The clinical interaction between acetylcholinesterase antagonists and mivacurium induced neuromuscular blockade was studied. METHOD: Intraoperative muscle relaxation was maintained with a mivacurium infusion to achieve a constant intense block (first twitch, T1, 2-3{\%} of control). Patients were randomly divided into three groups. Patients in Group 1 received no anticholinesterase, in Group 2 neostigmine 0.07 mg.kg-1, and in Group 3 edrophonium 1 mg.kg-1. The times between termination of the mivacurium infusion (Group 1) or the administration of the anticholinesterase (Groups 2 and 3) to 25{\%}, 50{\%}, 75{\%} and 95{\%} T1 recovery, and to 50{\%}, 70{\%} and 90{\%} recovery in the ratio, T4/T1 (TR) were recorded. RESULT: In the neostigmine Group, T1 recovery to 25{\%}, 50{\%} and 75{\%} (2.32 +/- 1.41, 3.90 +/- 1.85 and 6.88 +/- 2.66 min) was accelerated compared with control (3.36 +/- 1.34, 5.78 +/- 2.22, and 8.58 +/- 3.60, and), but recovery to 95{\%} (18.53 +/- 9.09 vs 13.29 +/- 5.24 min) was delayed. Also, TR recovery to 50{\%}, 70{\%}, and 90{\%} was slower (14.47 +/- 8.73, 21.25 +/- 11.06 and 31.37 +/- 12.11 min vs 11.75 +/- 3.74, 13.78 +/- 4.39 and 17.86 +/- 6.44 min). However, all T1 and TR recovery times were decreased in the edrophonium group (0.88 +/- 0.51, 2.00 +/- 1.50, 4.97 +/- 2.96, and 9.35 +/- 5.24 min for T1 and 6.86 +/- 3.93, 9.05 +/- 4.51 and 12.24 +/- 6.66 min for TR). CONCLUSION: Neostigmine reversal of intense mivacurium neuromuscular block should be avoided, as this may result in prolongation of the block.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to determine the optimum time for administration of neostigmine during recovery from atracurium-induced neuromuscular blockade. METHODS: The study comprised 103 patients anaesthetised with midazolam, fentanyl, thiopentone, halothane, and nitrous oxide. Relaxation was induced with atracurium 0.5 mg. kg-1 and maintained with supplements of 0.15 mg. kg-1. The ulnar nerve was stimulated with train-of-four (TOF) and double burst stimulation (DBS). Evoked MMG responses were recorded. Patients were randomized to spontaneous recovery (n = 20) or to assisted recovery by neostigmine (0.07 mg.kg-1) at varying intervals (6-50 min) from the last atracurium dose (n = 83). RESULTS: The reversal time (time from administration of neostigmine to TOF ratio 0.7) was always < 13 min, when T1 (first twitch in TOF) was detectable or when D1 (first twitch in DBS) was > 5{\%}. Total assisted recovery time (time from last supplemental atracurium dose to TOF ratio 0.7) increased with increasing T1 and D1 twitch heights (P < 0.05). The curve fitted to the scattergram with total assisted recovery time vs time from last atracurium supplement to neostigmine administration decreased to reach a minimum after which it increased to approach the line of identity. The minimum of the curve (total assisted recovery time 30.7 min) was reached when neostigmine was given 18.6 min after last atracurium supplement. At this time the T1 and D1 twitch height averaged 4 and 8{\%} respectively. If prolongation of the minimum total recovery time of 2.5{\%} is accepted, neostigmine can be given at T1 and D1 twitch height values of 0 to 8{\%} and 4 to 15{\%}, respectively. CONCLUSION: The optimum time for neostigmine administration, taking both the reversal time and total recovery time into consideration, is when 0 < T1 < 8{\%} or when 5 < D1 < 15{\%}. Giving neostigmine at more profound degrees of blockade prolongs reversal time, while giving neostigmine later in the recovery phase prolongs total recovery time.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mivacurium, a nondepolarizing muscle relaxant, is hydrolyzed by butyrylcholinesterase. The use of butyrylcholinesterase for antagonism of profound mivacurium-induced blockade has not been studied in humans. In part 1 of this two-part study, the authors examined the relationship between the posttetanic count (PTC) and recovery from profound mivacurium-induced blockade. In part 2, an attempt was made to antagonize a quantified level of profound mivacurium-induced blockade using either butyrylcholinesterase, edrophonium, or neostigmine. METHODS: Eighty-seven ASA physical status 1 or 2 adult patients were given 0.15 mg.kg-1 mivacurium during fentanyl-thiopental-nitrous oxide-isoflurane anesthesia. They were randomly assigned to eight groups. Neuromuscular function was monitored by recording the mechanomyographic response of the adductor pollicis to PTC and train-of-four (TOF) stimulation in all patients except those in group 1 where the TOF was the only pattern used. In part 1, neuromuscular function was allowed to recover spontaneously in ten patients (group 1; control-TOF) until TOF ratio (the amplitude of the fourth evoked response as a fraction of the first evoked response T4/T1) had reached 0.75. The temporal relationship between PTC and the first reaction to TOF stimulation was determined in another 31 patients, and neuromuscular function in 10 of these patients was allowed to recover spontaneously until TOF ratio had reached 0.75. The temporal relationship between PTC and the first reaction to TOF stimulation was determined in another 21 patients, and neuromuscular function in 10 of these patients was allowed to recover spontaneously, until TOF ratio had reached 0.75 (group 2; control-PTC). In part 2, the antagonism of mivacurium-induced profound (PTC > or = 1; groups 3-6) and 90{\%} block (groups 7-8) of twitch height were investigated in another 56 patients. Groups 3 and 7 received neostigmine 0.06 mg.kg-1 whereas groups 4 and 8 received edrophonium 1 mg.kg-1, respectively. Groups 5 and 6 received exogenous human butyrylcholinesterase equivalent to activity present in 25 or 70 ml.kg-1 of human plasma, respectively. RESULTS: Neither butyrylcholinesterase nor edrophonium shortened the times from first PTC response to TOF = 0.75 compared to group 2. Neostigmine resulted in prolongation of recovery time. There was a linear relationship (r = -0.80; P = 0.00001) between PTC and time of onset of TOF response. CONCLUSIONS: There appears to be no clinical advantage in attempting to antagonize profound mivacurium-induced neuromuscular blockade.},

@article{Servin1996,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Steroid muscle relaxants often display pharmacodynamic changes in patients with cirrhosis because of alterations in elimination processes. Rocuronium is a new steroid muscle relaxant possibly eliminated through the liver. This study was designed to compare rocuronium pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics in cirrhotic and healthy patients. METHODS: Rocuronium was administered to 26 cirrhotic patients and 24 control subjects anesthetized with isoflurane for an elective procedure. Patients were randomly allocated to received an initial dose of rocuronium: 120, 180, 250, or 300 micrograms.kg-1. Dose-response curves were established, and ED50 was calculated. Preselected maintenance doses (75, 150, or 225 micrograms.kg-1) were administered at 25{\%} recovery of twitch height to compare clinical duration of action. At the end of the procedure, relaxation was reversed in half of the patients, and the time course of recovery was compared in the two groups. Blood samples drawn during the procedure and after the last maintenance dose allowed pharmacokinetic analysis in six cirrhotic patients and six control subjects. RESULTS: ED50 of the initial dose was 144 micrograms.kg-1 in cirrhotic patients and 60 micrograms.kg-1 in control subjects, related to a higher initial volume of distribution (cirrhotic 78.5 +/- 31.7 ml.kg-1, control 29.8 +/- 17.3 ml.kg-1). Time from complementary dose to 25{\%} recovery was longer in cirrhotic patients (41.0 +/- 20.7 min vs 30.2 +/- 9.7 min), but time course of action during maintenance was not statistically different in the two groups. In cirrhotic patients receiving five maintenance doses or more, prolongation of the duration of action with successive maintenance doses could be statistically demonstrated. Spontaneous recovery was delayed in cirrhotic patients, because of impaired elimination processes: greater volume of distribution at steady-state (264 +/- 92 vs. 151 +/- 59 ml.kg-1); trend toward a lower clearance (189 +/- 60 vs. 296 +/- 169 ml.min-1). CONCLUSIONS: Rocuronium pharmacodynamics are moderately altered by cirrhosis, possible because of pharmacokinetic alterations. Individual variability in response to rocuronium is great, and dosage should be carefully titrated to that required.},

	abstract = {We performed this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to determine whether reversal of neuromuscular block with neostigmine increases the incidence and severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). We studied 162 women undergoing abdominal hysterectomy and randomly allocated them into two groups. In Group A, neuromuscular block produced with mivacurium was antagonized with neostigmine 2.0 mg and glycopyrrolate 0.4 mg intravenously, whereas Group B received no drugs to facilitate antagonism of blockade. The incidence and severity of PONV was assessed up to 27 h after the operation. There was no difference in PONV between the groups (in Group A 35{\%} had nausea and 33{\%} vomited; in Group B 28{\%} nauseated and 40{\%} vomited) or in the amount of antiemetics given. We had a 75{\%} chance to find a 30{\%} difference in PONV. We conclude that the administration of neostigmine and glycopyrrolate at the end of anesthesia to reverse neuromuscular block does not increase the incidence or severity of PONV. IMPLICATIONS: Neostigmine may increase postoperative nausea and vomiting. In this study, omission of reversal of neuromuscular block with neostigmine failed to decrease the incidence or severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A double-blind, randomized study compared differences between patients administered edrophonium and those administered placebo after mivacurium infusion. Neuromuscular blockade was quantified using the ParaGraph 1800 nerve stimulator-monitor (Vital Signs, Totowa, NJ), which can deliver a train-of-four stimulus to the ulnar nerve and quantify the ratio of the fourth twitch to the first twitch. METHODS: With Investigational Review Board approval and informed consent, 30 healthy outpatient gynecological surgery patients ASA I or II, aged 21 to 37 years, were randomly assigned to treatment or placebo. In a double-blind manner, one group received edrophonium (1 mg/kg) and atropine (0.01 mg/kg) reversal (E/A) and the other group received placebo (P) to recover spontaneously from a mivacurium infusion. Anesthesia was induced and a rapid infusion of mivacurium chloride (0.2 mg/kg) was administered. An infusion of mivacurium chloride was then initiated at a rate of 6-7 microg/kg/min to maintain neuromuscular blockade. Group differences in recovery time (time between administration of the edrophonium or placebo and a 5-second head lift followed by tracheal extubation) were compared, as was time from tracheal extubation to discharge from the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). Nausea and vomiting were documented until the patient was discharged from the hospital; a 24-hour follow-up evaluation was completed by telephone. RESULTS: Each group contained 15 patients, and their demographics were similar. The mean recovery time for E/A was statistically shorter than for P (P, 9.7 +/- 4.8 minutes; E/A, 6.1 +/- 3.9 minutes; p = 0. 017). There were no statistically significant differences found in the incidence of nausea and vomiting (P, 4; E/A, 6) or in time to discharge from the PACU. CONCLUSION: Recovery from a mivacurium chloride infusion is shorter by 3.6 minutes (margin of error +/- 3.3 minutes) when reversal with edrophonium/atropine is used. There is no difference in time to discharge from PACU and no evidence of differences in nausea and vomiting.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To study the efficacy of neostigmine compared with placebo for the antagonism of neuromuscular blockade at the end of a mivacurium infusion, and to determine its optimal dose. METHODS: One hundred adult patients undergoing an elective surgical procedure received a standardized anaesthetic with 20-30 micrograms.kg-1 alfentanil, a propofol infusion and nitrous oxide. Muscle relaxation was maintained at 90-95{\%} T1 depression with 0.2 mg.kg-1 mivacurium followed by an infusion. Neuromuscular blockade was measured with an integrated evoked electromyogram in response to train-of-four (TOF) stimuli at the ulnar nerve every 20 sec. Patients were randomized into four groups. At the end of surgery, the mivacurium infusion was stopped and patients received, immediately, in a double-blind manner, neostigmine (10, 20, or 40 micrograms.kg-1) or placebo according to a random number table. The T1 and TOF ratio were recorded until adequate recovery of neuromuscular function (TOF ratio > 0.70). During the reversal period, non-invasive blood pressure and heart rate were recorded every minute. The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) was recorded in the recovery room. RESULTS: Data from 94 patients who completed the protocol were analysed. Compared with placebo, neostigmine 10 micrograms.kg-1 did not reduce the time to TOF > 0.70 (17.0 +/- 5.1 vs 14.6 +/- 4.2 min respectively). However the time was decreased with neostigmine 20 micrograms.kg-1 and 40 micrograms.kg-1 (P < 0.001), but with no difference between these last two groups (11.4 +/- 3.0 and 11.4 +/- 3.5 min respectively). Changes in systolic blood pressure and heart rate were not different between the four groups. Very few PONV events were observed in all groups (global incidence 7.4{\%}). CONCLUSION: Recovery of neuromuscular blockade following a mivacurium infusion is accelerated by neostigmine. A dose of neostigmine 20 micrograms.kg-1 appears optimal with no further reduction in recovery time obtained from a larger dose.},

Eighty adults and 80 children were randomized to receive 0.45 mg/kg rocuronium or 0.075 mg/kg vecuronium during propofol/fentanyl/N2O anesthesia. Neuromuscular blockade was monitored by train-of-four (TOF) stimulation and adductor pollicis electromyography. Further randomization was made to control (no neostigmine) or reversal with 0.07 mg/kg neostigmine/0.01 mg/kg glycopyrrolate given 5 min after relaxant, or first twitch (T1) recovery of 1{\%}, 10{\%}, or 25{\%}. Another eight adults and eight children received 1.5 mg/kg succinylcholine. At each age, spontaneous recovery of T1 and TOF was similar after rocuronium and vecuronium administration but was more rapid in children (P < 0.05). Spontaneous recovery to TOF0.7 after rocuronium and vecuronium administration in adults was 45.7 +/- 11.5 min and 52.5 +/- 15.6 min; in children, it was 28.8 +/- 7.8 min and 34.6 +/- 9.0 min. Neostigmine accelerated recovery in all reversal groups (P < 0.05) by approximately 40{\%}, but the times from relaxant administration to TOF0.7 were similar and independent of the timing of neostigmine administration. Recovery to T1 90{\%} after succinylcholine was similar in adults (9.4 +/- 5.0 min) and children (8.4 +/- 1.1 min) and was shorter than recovery to TOF0.7 in any reversal group after rocuronium or vecuronium administration. Recovery from rocuronium and vecuronium blockade after neostigmine administration was more rapid in children than in adults. Return of neuromuscular function after reversal was not influenced by the timing of neostigmine administration. These results suggest that reversal of intense rocuronium or vecuronium neuromuscular blockade need not be delayed until return of appreciable neuromuscular function has been demonstrated. IMPLICATIONS: These results suggest that reversal of intense rocuronium or vecuronium neuromuscular blockade need not be delayed until return of appreciable neuromuscular function has been demonstrated. Although spontaneous and neostigmine-assisted recovery is more rapid in children than in adults, in neither is return of function as rapid as after succinylcholine administration.},

	abstract = {We have investigated the dose-effect relationship of neostigmine in antagonizing vecuronium-induced neuromuscular block with and without magnesium sulphate (MgSO4) pretreatment. Neuromuscular block was assessed by electromyography with train-of-four (TOF) stimulation. First, we determined neostigmine-induced recovery in patients pretreated with MgSO4 (group A) or saline (group B) (n = 12 each). The height of T1, 5 min after neostigmine, was 43 (7){\%} in group A and 65 (6){\%} in group B (P < 0.01). Respective values after 10 min were 59 (7){\%} and 83 (5){\%} (P < 0.01). TOF ratio, 5 min after neostigmine, was 29 (6){\%} in group A and 29 (5){\%} in group B. Respective values after 10 min were 38 (11){\%} and 51 (7){\%} (P < 0.01). To gain insight into the mechanisms leading to delayed recovery after MgSO4, we calculated assisted recovery, defined as neostigmine-induced recovery minus mean spontaneous recovery. Spontaneous recovery was assessed in another 24 patients. Patients in group C received MgSO4/vecuronium and patients in group D vecuronium only (n = 12 each). Five minutes after neostigmine, assisted recovery was 22 (7){\%} in the MgSO4 pretreated patients and 28 (6){\%} in controls (P < 0.05). Ten minutes after neostigmine, values were 24 (7){\%} and 22 (6){\%}. Maximum assisted recovery was not influenced by MgSO4 pretreatment (27 (6){\%} in group A and 32 (6){\%} in group B) and time to maximum effect was comparable between groups: 6 (4-10) min and 7 (5-8) min, respectively. We conclude that neostigmine-induced recovery was attenuated in patients treated with MgSO4. This was mainly a result of slower spontaneous recovery and not decreased response to neostigmine.},

	abstract = {The effects of neostigmine on the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are controversial. In this study, we evaluated the effects of neostigmine and glycopyrrolate on the incidence of PONV and the need for antiemetics in patients undergoing ambulatory surgery. One hundred healthy patients undergoing outpatient surgical procedures were included in the study. A standardized anesthetic technique was used for all patients. Patients were randomized to receive either mivacurium (n = 50) or rocuronium (n = 50) to achieve muscle paralysis. Bolus doses of mivacurium 2-4 mg or rocuronium 5-10 mg were administered to maintain one or two twitches of the train-of-four stimulation of the ulnar nerve at the wrist. After surgery, residual neuromuscular blockade was reversed with neostigmine 2.5 mg i.v. and glycopyrrolate 0.5 mg i.v. only if clinically deemed necessary (i.e., fade on train-of-four stimulation, inadequate tidal volume, reduced hand grip, or inability to maintain head lift). The incidence of PONV and the need for antiemetics were recorded in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), in the phase II unit, and 24 h after surgery. We compared patients who received neostigmine (n = 40) for reversal of residual neuromuscular blockade with those who did not (n = 60). More patients receiving rocuronium required reversal drugs than those receiving mivacurium (68{\%} vs 10{\%}). There were no differences in the incidence of nausea (18{\%} vs 15{\%}), vomiting (8{\%} vs 12{\%}), and the need for antiemetics (13{\%} in both the groups) in the PACU between patients who received neostigmine and those who did not. In addition, the duration of PACU stay and the time to home-readiness were also similar between the groups. We conclude that, compared with rocuronium, the use of mivacurium decreases the need for reversal drugs. In addition, reversal of residual neuromuscular blockade with neostigmine does not increase the incidence of PONV or the need for antiemetic medications in patients undergoing ambulatory surgery. IMPLICATIONS: In this study, we showed that the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting and the need for antiemetics do not increase with the use of neostigmine and glycopyrrolate for reversal of residual muscle paralysis.},

@article{Lien1999,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The authors examined the plasma concentrations of the isomers of mivacurium and its pharmacodynamics during spontaeous and neostigmine-facilitated recovery after a mivacurium infusion. METHODS: Sixteen patients receiving nitrous oxide-opioid anesthesia received 0.25 mg/kg mivacurium. Patient response to neuromuscular stimulation was determined using a mechanomyograph Once T1 had recovered to 25{\%} of its baseline height, a mivacurium infusion was begun and adjusted to maintain 95-99{\%} neuromuscular block. The infusion was discontinued after 90 min and muscle strength allowed to recover either spontaneously or after neostigmine/glycopyrrolate (0.05/0.01 mg/kg). Plasma concentrations of the isomers of mivacurium after discontinuation of the infusion were determined using an HPLC assay. Differences between the groups were determined using a one-way analysis of variance with a Bonferroni-corrected t test or Student t test as appropriate. P < or = 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Differences in the times for recovery to a train-of-four ratio of 70{\%} did not achieve statistical significance (mean+/-SD, 13.3+/-6.0 vs. 16.3+/-2.5 min for the neostigmine and spontaneous groups, respectively). Plasma cholinesterase activity decreased significantly from baseline values after administration of neostigmine (5.88+/-0.21 vs. 0.43+/-0.04 U/ml plasma). Plasma concentrations of the trans-trans isomer were significantly greater in the neostigmine group than in the spontaneous recovery group 5, 6, 8, and 10 min after discontinuation of the infusion. Differences in the plasma concentration of the cis-trans isomer did not achieve statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Although administration of neostigmine decreased plasma cholinesterase activity and caused the trans-trans isomer to remain in the plasma at higher concentration, it did not delay recovery from mivacurium-induced block.},

	abstract = {Spontaneous recovery, and recovery following neostigmine 20, 35 or 50 microgram.kg-1 administered at 10 or 25{\%} of recovery of the first twitch of the train-of-four, was assessed in 80 patients after rocuronium administration under continued isoflurane anaesthesia. In an additional 40 patients, isoflurane administration was discontinued and neostigmine 35 or 50 microgram.kg-1 was given at 10 or 25{\%} recovery. The administration of neostigmine reduced the recovery times significantly. A neostigmine dose of 20 microgram.kg-1 resulted in slower recovery compared with the higher doses, particularly when reversal was attempted at a first twitch height of 10{\%}. Higher doses of neostigmine given at a first twitch height of 25{\%} resulted in rapid reversal of block {$[$}mean (SD) times of 7.0 (4.8) and 6.4 (1.9) min with the 35 and 50 microgram.kg-1 doses, respectively, for attaining a train-of-four ratio of 0.8{$]$}. Discontinuing isoflurane did not alter recovery times. The incidence of emetic symptoms did not differ between groups, including one group that received atropine instead of glycopyrronium in combination with neostigmine. We conclude that rocuronium block can be antagonised safely using a neostigmine dose of 35 microgram.kg-1, although recovery may be slightly slower if administered at a first twitch of 10{\%} of control.},

@article{Lovstad2001,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neostigmine, used for reversal of neuromuscular block, has been implicated in the development of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). The use of mivacurium, which does not require neostigmine reversal due to its metabolism by plasma cholinesterase, has made it possible to study the effect of neostigmine on PONV in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled manner. METHODS: Ninety healthy women scheduled for laparoscopic gynaecological surgery were randomly allocated to two groups in a double-blind manner. One group was given neostigmine (50 microg kg(-1)) and glycopyrrolate (10 microg kg(-1)) (group NG), the other NaCl i.v. as placebo (group P) at the end of surgery when all the patients were spontaneously reversed to at least 75{\%} of full muscle power. The risk of PONV was reduced by using low doses of opioids and ondansetron prophylaxis. All the patients were monitored and assessed for 24 h with regard to pain, nausea, vomiting and overall satisfaction. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference (P=0.03) in the occurrence of nausea during the first 6 h postoperatively between NG group (30{\%}) and P group (11{\%}), resulting in the more extensive use of antiemetic drugs in the NG group (28{\%}) than in P group (7{\%}) (P=0.01) in this period. There was no difference between the groups in the frequency of vomiting; seven nauseated patients had vomiting, four in group NG, three in group P. Total number of patients with PONV during the observation period of 24 h, usage of antiemetic rescue medication and overall patient satisfaction did not differ significantly between the groups. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that antagonism of neuromuscular block with a high dose of neostigmine increases postoperative nausea and the use of antiemetic drugs during the first 6 h after administration.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Because tactile evaluation is the most common form of clinical neuromuscular monitoring, this study examines the relative efficacy of antagonizing residual block at different levels of recovery of the tactile train-of-four (TOF) response. METHODS: Anesthesia was induced in 64 adults with 2-5 microg/kg fentanyl and 1-3 mg/kg propofol and maintained with fentanyl, propofol, and nitrous oxide. The tactile response of the adductor pollicis to TOF stimulation was evaluated at one arm, and the mechanomyographic response was recorded at the other. Patients received 0.15 mg/kg cisatracurium and were randomized to receive 0.07 mg/kg neostigmine on reappearance of the first (group I), second (group II), third (group III), or fourth (group IV) tactile TOF response (16 patients per group). Times from administration of neostigmine until the TOF ratio recovered to 0.7 (R0.7), 0.8 (R0.8), and 0.9 (R0.9) were measured. RESULTS: Data are presented as median with range in parentheses. R0.7 was 10.3 (5.9-23.4), 7.6 (3.2-14.1), 5.0 (2.0-18.4), and 4.1 (2.4-11.0) min in groups I, II, III, and IV, respectively (P < 0.05, group I > II, III, and IV, group II > IV). R0.8 was 16.6 (8.9-30.7), 9.8 (5.3-25.0), 8.3 (3.8-27.1), and 7.5 (3.0-74.5) min in groups I, II, III, and IV, respectively (P < 0.05, group I > II, III, and IV, group II > IV). R0.9 was 22.2 (13.9-44.0), 20.2 (6.5-70.5), 17.1 (8.3-46.2), and 16.5 (6.5-143.3) min in groups I, II, III, and IV, respectively (no intergroup differences). Ten minutes after neostigmine, a TOF ratio of 0.7 or greater was achieved in 50, 75, 88, and 93{\%} of patients in groups I, II, III, and IV, respectively (P < 0.05 group I > II, III, and IV). At 30 min, a TOF ratio of 0.9 or less was observed in 21, 13, 13, and 7{\%} of patients in groups I, II, III, and IV respectively (no intergroup differences). CONCLUSIONS: To achieve rapid (within 10 min) reversal to a TOF ratio of 0.7 in more than 87{\%} of patients, three or four tactile responses should be present at the time of neostigmine administration. It was not possible within 30 min to achieve a TOF ratio of 0.9 in all patients, regardless of the number of tactile responses present at neostigmine administration.},

Fifty-one patients aged 3 to 10 years, ASA physical status 1 or 2 were randomized to 4 groups: a spontaneous recovery group; or, reversal with pyridostigmine 0.25 mg/kg with glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg at one of three times: 5 minutes after rocuronium administration; at 1{\%} twitch height (T1) recovery; or at a 25{\%} twitch height (T25) recovery. Anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone (5-7 mg/kg) and maintained with 2-3{\%} sevoflurane and 50{\%} nitrous oxide. Atropine (0.015 mg/kg) and, after calibrating the TOF-Watch, rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg) were then administered. Maximal block occurred 1.1+/-0.5 min (mean, SD) after rocuronium administration. In the spontaneous recovery group, the clinical duration (recovery to T25) was 40.1+/-8.8 min and the recovery index (time between T25 and T75) 19.9+/-9.8 min. Recovery to TOF >0.9 from the time of rocuronium administration was reduced by approximately 30{\%} in the pyridostigmine groups compared to the spontaneous recovery group. There was no significant difference among the three pyridostigmine groups. When pyridostigmine was given at T1 or T25, the time from pyridostigmine administration to TOF >0.9 was shorter than for the group receiving pyridostigmine 5 minutes after rocuronium.},

	abstract = {AIMS: To compare the pharmacodynamics of cisatracurium and rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block following single dose, allowing either spontaneous or neostigmine-accelerated complete recovery. METHODS: Following the ethics committee approval and informed consent, 120 patients scheduled for elective surgery under TIVA with tracheal intubation were randomized into 4 groups with different cisatracurium (CIS, 0.10 or 0.15 mg.kg(-1)) or rocuronium (ROC, 0.60 or 0.90 mg.kg(-1)) doses administered. For each patient, the onset time for 95 {\%} depression of T1, clinical duration until 25 {\%} recovery, recovery index (T1 from 25 to 75 {\%}) and time from T1 25 {\%} to TOF-ratio 0.9 were determined allowing either spontaneous or induced recovery. RESULTS: The onset times were 277 (SD 58), 220 (46), 91 (16) and 77 (16) s for the CIS 0.10, CIS 0.15, ROC 0.60 and ROC 0.90 groups (p < 0.05), respectively, with lower variability in both ROC groups (p < 0.05). The clinical durations were 42 (7), 52 (7), 35 (11) and 52 (12) min, respectively (p < 0.05 for lower doses). Recovery index was identical in all groups allowing either spontaneous recovery - 15.9 (1.8), 15.5 (1.7), 16.1 (3.7) and 16.1 (4.0) min, or following neostigmine administration - 4.4 (0.9), 4.5 (0.8), 4.3 (0.8) and 4.7 (0.7) min for respective groups. During spontaneous recovery, the variability of DUR25-TOF90 was twice as great for ROC than CIS groups (p < 0.05), while after neostigmine administration it was uniform in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: For equipotent doses, the onset times for CIS were approximately three times longer than for ROC. The average clinical duration for both relaxants ranged from 35 to 52 min with acceptable variability. Neostigmine administration accelerated the recovery and reduced its variability. When allowing for spontaneous recovery, less scatter was demonstrated for both CIS groups than for ROC ones.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sugammadex (Org 25969) forms a complex with steroidal neuromuscular blocking agents, thereby reversing neuromuscular block. This study investigated the dose-response relation, safety, and pharmacokinetics of sugammadex to reverse rocuronium-induced block. METHODS: Twenty-seven male surgical patients aged 18-64 yr were randomly assigned to receive placebo or sugammadex (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, or 4.0 mg/kg) for reversal of 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block. Anesthesia was induced and maintained using intravenous fentanyl and propofol. Neuromuscular function was assessed using acceleromyography. Sugammadex or placebo was administered at reappearance of T2 of the train-of-four. The primary efficacy variable was the time required for recovery to a train-of-four ratio of 0.9. RESULTS: Sugammadex decreased median recovery time in a dose-dependent manner from 21.0 min in the placebo group to 1.1 min in the group receiving 4.0 mg/kg sugammadex. Doses of sugammadex of 2.0 mg/kg or greater reversed rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block within 3 min. A median of 59-77{\%} of sugammadex was excreted unchanged in the urine within 16 h, mostly in the first 8 h. Sugammadex increased the proportion of the rocuronium dose excreted unchanged in the urine (from a median of 19{\%} in the placebo group to 53{\%} in the 4.0-mg/kg group within 16 h). Sugammadex was safe and well tolerated. No evidence of recurarization was observed in any patient. CONCLUSION: At doses of 2.0 mg/kg or greater, sugammadex safely reversed 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block in a dose-dependent manner. Sugammadex enhanced renal excretion of rocuronium and was excreted unchanged by the kidneys.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade can be accomplished by chemical encapsulation of rocuronium by sugammadex, a modified gamma-cyclodextrin derivative. This study investigated the efficacy and safety of sugammadex in reversing rocuronium-induced profound neuromuscular blockade at 5 min in American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I and II patients. METHODS: Forty-five American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I and II patients (aged 18-64 yr) scheduled to undergo surgical procedures (anticipated anesthesia duration >/= 90 min) were randomly assigned to a phase II, multicenter, assessor-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel, dose-finding study. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with propofol and an opioid. Profound neuromuscular blockade was induced with 1.2 mg/kg rocuronium bromide. Sugammadex (2.0, 4.0, 8.0, 12.0, or 16.0 mg/kg) or placebo (0.9{\%} saline) was then administered 5 min after the administration of rocuronium. Neuromuscular function was monitored by acceleromyography, using train-of-four nerve stimulation. Recovery time was the time from the start of administration of sugammadex or placebo, to recovery of the train-of-four ratio to 0.9. Safety assessments were performed on the day of the operation and during the postoperative and follow-up period. RESULTS: A total of 43 patients received either sugammadex or placebo. Increasing doses of sugammadex reduced the mean recovery time from 122 min (spontaneous recovery) to less than 2 min in a dose-dependent manner. Signs of recurrence of blockade were not observed. No serious adverse events related to sugammadex were reported. Two adverse events possibly related to sugammadex were reported in two patients (diarrhea and light anesthesia); however, both patients recovered without sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: Sugammadex rapidly and effectively reversed profound rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade in humans and was well tolerated.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sugammadex is a modified {$[$}gamma{$]$} cyclodextrin compound, which encapsulates rocuronium to provide for a rapid reversal of residual neuromuscular blockade. We tested the hypothesis that sugammadex would provide for a more rapid reversal of a moderately profound residual rocuronium-induced blockade than the commonly used cholinesterase inhibitors, edrophonium and neostigmine. METHODS: Sixty patients undergoing elective surgery procedures with a standardized desflurane-remifentanil-rocuronium anesthetic technique received either sugammadex, 4 mg/kg IV (n = 20), edrophonium, 1 mg/kg IV and atropine, 10 microg/kg IV (n = 20), or neostigmine, 70 microg/kg IV and glycopyrrolate, 14 microg/kg IV (n = 20) for reversal of neuromuscular blockade at 15 min or longer after the last dose of rocuronium using acceleromyography to record the train-of-four (TOF) responses. Mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate values were recorded immediately before and for 30 min after reversal drug administration. Side effects were noted at discharge from the postanesthesia care unit. RESULTS: The three groups were similar with respect to their demographic characteristics and total dosages of rocuronium prior to administering the study medication. Although the initial twitch heights (T1) at the time of reversal were similar in all three groups, the time to achieve TOF ratios of 0.7 and 0.9 were significantly shorter with sugammadex (71 +/- 25 and 107 +/- 61 s) than edrophonium (202 +/- 171 and 331 +/- 27 s) or neostigmine (625 +/- 341 and 1044 +/- 590 s). All patients in the sugammadex group achieved a TOF ratio of 0.9 < or =5 min after reversal administration compared with none and 5{\%} in the edrophonium and neostigmine groups, respectively. Heart rate values at 2 and 5 min after reversal were significantly higher in the neostigmine-glycopyrrolate group compared with that in sugammadex. Finally, the incidence of dry mouth was significantly reduced in the sugammadex group (5{\%} vs 85{\%} and 95{\%} in the neostigmine and edrophonium groups, respectively). CONCLUSION: Sugammadex, 4 mg/kg IV, more rapidly and effectively reversed residual neuromuscular blockade when compared with neostigmine (70 microg/kg IV) and edrophonium (1 mg/kg IV). Use of sugammadex was associated with less frequent dry mouth than that with the currently used reversal drug combinations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sugammadex reverses the neuromuscular blocking effects of rocuronium by chemical encapsulation. The efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of sugammadex for reversal of profound rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade were evaluated. METHODS: Ninety-eight male adult patients were randomly assigned to receive sugammadex (1, 2, 4, 6, or 8 mg/kg) or placebo at 3, 5, or 15 min after 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium. Patients were anesthetized with propofol and fentanyl. The primary endpoint of the study was the time to achieve a recovery of train-of-four ratio to 0.9. Neuromuscular blockade was measured using acceleromyography. Concentrations of rocuronium and sugammadex were determined in venous blood and urine samples. A population pharmacokinetic model using NONMEM (GloboMax LLC, Hanover, MD) was applied. RESULTS: The mean time to recovery of the train-of-four ratio to 0.9 after dosing at 3, 5, and 15 min decreased from 52.1, 51.7, and 35.6 min, respectively, after administration of placebo to 1.8, 1.5, and 1.4 min, respectively, after 8 mg/kg sugammadex. Sugammadex was safe and well tolerated. However, 20.4{\%} of patients showed signs of inadequate anesthesia after its administration. The median cumulative excretion of rocuronium in the urine over 24 h was 26{\%} in the placebo group and increased to 58-74{\%} after 4-8 mg/kg sugammadex. The mean plasma clearances of sugammadex and rocuronium were 0.084 and 0.26 l/min, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In male subjects, sugammadex safely reversed profound neuromuscular blockade induced by 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium in a dose-dependent manner. Sugammadex enhanced the renal excretion of rocuronium, and its clearance is approximately one third that of rocuronium.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sugammadex rapidly reverses rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block. This study explored the dose-response relation of sugammadex given as a reversal agent at reappearance of the second muscle twitch after rocuronium- and vecuronium-induced block. A secondary objective was to investigate the safety of single doses of sugammadex. METHODS: In this two-center, phase II, dose-finding study, 80 patients (age >or= 18 yr, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II, surgery >or= 60 min requiring muscle relaxation for intubation) were randomly assigned to receive rocuronium (0.60 mg/kg) or vecuronium (0.10 mg/kg). Sugammadex or placebo was administered at reappearance of the second muscle twitch. The primary efficacy endpoint was time from starting sugammadex administration until recovery of the train-of-four ratio to 0.9. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, sugammadex produced dose-dependent decreases in mean time to recovery for all train-of-four ratios in the rocuronium and vecuronium groups. The mean time for recovery of the train-of-four ratio to 0.9 in the rocuronium group was 31.8 min after placebo compared with 3.7 and 1.1 min after 0.5 and 4.0 mg/kg sugammadex, respectively. The mean time for recovery of the train-of-four ratio to 0.9 in the vecuronium group was 48.8 min after placebo, compared with 2.5 and 1.4 min after 1.0 and 8.0 mg/kg sugammadex, respectively. Sugammadex was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Sugammadex rapidly reversed rocuronium- or vecuronium-induced neuromuscular block at reappearance of the second muscle twitch and was well tolerated. A dose-response relation was observed with sugammadex for reversal of both rocuronium- and vecuronium-induced neuromuscular block.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of epidurally administered mepivacaine on recovery from vecuronium-induced neuromuscular block. METHODS: Eighty patients were randomly assigned to one of two study groups. They were either given epidurally a bolus of 0.15 ml kg(-1) of mepivacaine 2{\%}, followed by repetitive injections of 0.1 ml kg(-1) h(-1) throughout the study, or were not given epidurally. General anaesthesia was induced and maintained with fentanyl, propofol and nitrous oxide. Neuromuscular block was induced with vecuronium 0.1 mg kg(-1) and monitored using acceleromyographic train-of-four (TOF) at the adductor pollicis. Patients in each treatment group were randomized to receive neostigmine 0.04 mg kg(-1) at 25{\%} recovery of the first twitch of TOF or to recover spontaneously to a TOF ratio of 0.9. The effect of epidural mepivacaine on speed of spontaneous and facilitated recovery of neuromuscular function was evaluated. RESULTS: The time from administration of vecuronium to spontaneous recovery to a TOF ratio of 0.9 was significantly longer in the epidural mepivacaine group {$[$}105.4 (14.2) min{$]$} as compared with the control group {$[$}78.5 (9.1) min, P < 0.01{$]$}. Neostigmine administered at 25{\%} of control in T1 shortened recovery from neuromuscular block, however the time required for facilitated recovery to a TOF ratio of 0.9 in the epidural group was significantly longer than that in the control group {$[$}7.6 (1.6) min vs 5.8 (2.1) min, P < 0.01{$]$}. CONCLUSIONS: In clinical anaesthesia, it should be recognized that epidurally administered mepivacaine delays considerably the TOF recovery from neuromuscular block.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reversal of the residual effect of rocuronium or cisatracurium by neostigmine may be slow and associated with side-effects. This randomized, safety-assessor-blinded study compared the efficacy of sugammadex, a selective relaxant binding agent for reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block, with that of neostigmine for reversal of cisatracurium-induced neuromuscular block. The safety of sugammadex and neostigmine was also evaluated. METHODS: Adult surgical patients (ASA class I-III) were randomized to sugammadex 2.0 mg kg(-1) for reversal of block induced by rocuronium 0.6 mg kg(-1), or neostigmine 50 microg kg(-1) for reversal of block induced by cisatracurium 0.15 mg kg(-1). Anaesthesia was induced and maintained using i.v. propofol and remifentanil, fentanyl, or sufentanil. Neuromuscular function was monitored using acceleromyography (TOF-Watch SX). Sugammadex or neostigmine was administered at reappearance of T(2). The primary efficacy variable was time for recovery of the train-of-four (TOF) ratio to 0.9. RESULTS: Eighty-four patients were randomized, 73 of whom received sugammadex (n=34) or neostigmine (n=39). Time from start of administration of reversal agent to recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.9 was 4.7 times faster with sugammadex than with neostigmine (geometric mean=1.9 vs 9.0 min, P<0.0001). Reversal of block was sustained in all patients. There were no serious adverse effects from either reversal agent and no significant changes in any measure of safety, except for similar elevations in urinary N-acetyl glucosaminidase in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Sugammadex 2.0 mg kg(-1) administered at reappearance of T(2) was significantly faster in reversing rocuronium-induced blockade than neostigmine was in reversing cisatracurium-induced block.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Traditionally, reversal of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents was achieved using acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, but these are unable to adequately reverse profound blockade. Sugammadex is a novel reversal agent, reversing the effects of rocuronium by encapsulation. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of sugammadex versus neostigmine for reversal of profound rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade. METHODS: This phase III, randomized study enrolled surgical patients, aged 18 yr or older with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-IV. Patients were randomized to receive sugammadex (4.0 mg/kg) or neostigmine (70 microg/kg) plus glycopyrrolate (14 microg/kg). Anesthetized patients received an intubating dose of rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg), with maintenance doses (0.15 mg/kg) as required. Neuromuscular monitoring was performed by acceleromyography. Sugammadex or neostigmine was administered at reappearance of 1-2 posttetanic counts (profound neuromuscular blockade). The primary efficacy parameter was the time from sugammadex or neostigmine-glycopyrrolate administration to return of the train-of-four ratio to 0.9. RESULTS: In the intent-to-treat population (n = 37 in each group), geometric mean time to recovery to a train-of-four ratio of 0.9 with sugammadex was 2.9 min versus 50.4 min with neostigmine-glycopyrrolate (P < 0.0001) (median, 2.7 min vs. 49.0 min). Most sugammadex patients (97{\%}) recovered to a train-of-four ratio of 0.9 within 5 min after administration. In contrast, most neostigmine patients (73{\%}) recovered between 30 and 60 min after administration, with 23{\%} requiring more than 60 min to recover to a train-of-four ratio of 0.9. CONCLUSIONS: Recovery from profound rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade was significantly faster with sugammadex versus with neostigmine, suggesting that sugammadex has a unique ability to rapidly reverse profound rocuronium neuromuscular blockade.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sugammadex (Org 25969), a novel, selective relaxant binding agent, was specifically designed to rapidly reverse rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade. The efficacy and safety of sugammadex for the reversal of profound, high-dose rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade was evaluated. METHODS: A total of 176 adult patients were randomly assigned to receive sugammadex (2, 4, 8, 12, or 16 mg/kg) or placebo at 3 or 15 min after high-dose rocuronium (1.0 or 1.2 mg/kg) during propofol anesthesia. The primary endpoint was time to recovery of the train-of-four ratio to 0.9. Neuromuscular monitoring was performed using acceleromyography. RESULTS: Sugammadex administered 3 or 15 min after injection of 1 mg/kg rocuronium decreased the median recovery time of the train-of-four ratio to 0.9 in a dose-dependent manner from 111.1 min and 91.0 min (placebo) to 1.6 min and 0.9 min (16 mg/kg sugammadex), respectively. After 1.2 mg/kg rocuronium, sugammadex decreased time to recovery of train-of-four from 124.3 min (3-min group) and 94.2 min (15-min group) to 1.3 min and 1.9 min with 16 mg/kg sugammadex, respectively. There was no clinical evidence of reoccurrence of neuromuscular blockade or residual neuromuscular blockade. Exploratory analysis revealed that prolongation of the corrected QT interval considered as possibly related to sugammadex occurred in one patient. Another two patients developed markedly abnormal arterial blood pressure after sugammadex that lasted approximately 15 min. CONCLUSION: Sugammadex provides a rapid and dose-dependent reversal of profound neuromuscular blockade induced by high-dose rocuronium (1.0 or 1.2 mg/kg) in adult surgical patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) are widely used during the induction and maintenance of anesthesia. Postoperative residual curarization (PORC) following the use of NMBAs still occurs even though intermediate-acting NMBAs were used. Train-of-four (TOF) stimulation is used to quantify the degree of neuromuscular blockade. The TOF ratio of 0.7 in the adductor pollicis muscle was associated with normal respiratory function. Pharyngeal function returned to normal while the TOF ratio reached 0.9. The aim of this study was to survey the PORC in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). METHODS: In this observational study, 308 patients who received general anesthesia with NMBAs were enrolled. Residual curarization was evaluated using the TOF-Watch acceleromyograph upon arrival in the PACU. Three consecutive TOF stimulations were applied and recorded at 15-second intervals. Two thresholds of TOF ratios (0.9 and 0.7) were used to assess the presence of residual curarization. RESULTS: TOF ratios less than 0.7 and 0.9 were observed in 15 (5{\%}), and 97 (31{\%}) patients, respectively. The differences of the TOF ratios between the male and female patients were significant (p = 0.014). In terms of weight, the differences between the patients with ratios > 0.9 and < or = 0.9 were significant (p = 0.013). There were 67, 49, 15, and three patients who received reversal medication in the > 0.9 group, < or = 0.9 and > 0.7 group, and < or = 0.7 group, respectively. The differences of the TOF ratios between the patients who received and those who did not receive reversal medication were not significant (p = 0.91). CONCLUSION: PORC is still a clinical problem in the modern PACU. Objective neuromuscular monitoring needs to be performed to ensure patient safety.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The present randomized, safety-assessor blinded, placebo-controlled trial was designed to assess safety and efficacy of sugammadex, a novel selective relaxant-binding agent, in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease undergoing noncardiac surgery. METHODS: Overall, 116 patients (New York Heart Association class II-III) were randomized and received sugammadex 2.0 mg kg (n = 38), sugammadex 4.0 mg kg (n = 38) or placebo (n = 40) for reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade at reappearance of T2. Safety variables included heart rate, blood pressure and electrocardiogram characteristics, including rate-corrected QT (QTc Fridericia and QTc Bazett) interval. Efficacy was evaluated as time to recovery of the T4/T1 ratio to 0.9 after administration of sugammadex or placebo. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between groups in terms of QTc (Fridericia) interval. Three serious adverse events, one in each treatment group, considered to be possibly drug-related according to the investigator, were cases of mild QTc (Bazett) interval prolongation. Blood pressure and heart rate decreased after initiation of anaesthesia and remained stable in all groups up to 10 min after administration of study drug. Blood pressure was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in both sugammadex dose groups compared with placebo at 30 min. The decrease in heart rate from baseline (prestudy drug) was significantly greater in the 2.0 mg kg sugammadex group at 2 and 5 min, and, for both sugammadex groups, the increase at 30 min was greater compared with placebo. Both sugammadex doses resulted in considerably shorter time to recovery of the T4/T1 ratio to 0.9 compared with placebo. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate sugammadex 2.0 and 4.0 mg kg can be given safely and effectively for the reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade in patients with cardiovascular disease undergoing noncardiac surgery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sugammadex reverses neuromuscular blockade by chemical encapsulation of rocuronium. This phase IIIA study explored efficacy and safety of sugammadex in infants (28 days to 23 months), children (2-11 yr), adolescents (12-17 yr), and adults (18-65 yr). METHODS: Anesthetized patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists class 1-2) received 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium and were randomized to receive sugammadex (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, or 4.0 mg/kg) or placebo at reappearance of T2. Neuromuscular monitoring was performed using acceleromyography. Primary endpoint was time from sugammadex/placebo administration to recovery of the train-of-four ratio to 0.9. Adverse events and electrocardiograms were recorded, and blood samples were collected for safety and determination of sugammadex and rocuronium plasma concentrations. RESULTS: A dose-response relation was demonstrated in children (n = 22), adolescents (n = 28), and adults (n = 26), but not infants because of the small sample size (n = 8). After placebo, median recovery time of train-of-four to 0.9 was 21.0, 19.0, 23.4, and 28.5 min in infants, children, adolescents, and adults, respectively. After 2.0 mg/kg sugammadex train-of-four 0.9 was attained in 0.6, 1.2, 1.1, and 1.2 min, respectively. The sugammadex plasma concentrations were similar for the children, adolescent, and adult age groups across the dose range. Sugammadex was well tolerated: No reoccurrence of blockade, inadequate reversal, significant QT prolongation, or other abnormalities were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Sugammadex is a new reversal agent that rapidly, effectively, safely, and with similar recovery times reverses rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade in children, adolescents, adults, and the small number of infants studied.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sugammadex is a modified gamma cyclodextrin compound which encapsulates rocuronium resulting in rapid reversal of residual neuromuscular blockade. We performed a post hoc analysis of data from a multicenter study designed to mimic standard clinical practice which would test the hypothesis that the presence (versus the absence) of a twitch response to neuromuscular stimulation at the time of reversal drug administration would influence the speed and completeness of the reversal effect of sugammadex. METHODS: One-hundred-seventy-one consenting patients undergoing general anesthesia with a volatile-based anesthetic technique were enrolled in a multicenter observational study. All patients received rocuronium, 0.6 mg/kg i.v. for tracheal intubation and maintenance boluses of 0.15 mg/kg i.v. as needed during surgery. The degree of rocuronium-induced blockade was assessed during anesthesia using a TOF-Watch-SX acceleromyograph to record the train-of-four (TOF) responses on a laptop computer from induction of anesthesia until the TOF ratio returned to > or = 0.9 after completion of the surgical procedure. The patients received sugammadex, 4 mg/kg i.v., for reversal of neuromuscular blockade > 15 min after the last dose of rocuronium. Recovery data were compared in patients with either no (0) (n = 89) or > or = 1 twitch (n = 82) in response to TOF stimulation at the time of reversal drug administration. RESULTS: The patients without a twitch response were more likely to be female (60{\%} vs 40{\%}) and had a shorter time interval between the last bolus dose of rocuronium and the administration of the reversal drug (31+/-18 vs 45+/-23 min, P < 0.05). The time to achieve a TOF ratio of 0.9 was prolonged in the 0 twitch group compared with the > or = 1 twitch response group (173+/-162 vs 104+/-73 s, P < 0.05). Overall, 84{\%} of the patients in the 0 twitch group recovered to a TOF of 0.9 in < or = 5 min compared to 91{\%} of the patients in the group with > or = 1 twitch (P < 0.05). The times to achieve a TOF of 0.9 varied from 0.8 to 22.3 and 0.7 to 8.5 min in the 0 twitch and > or = 1 twitch groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: Reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade by sugammadex was influenced by the degree of residual blockade at the time the reversal drug was administered. Despite the wide variability, reversal of the TOF ratio to 0.9 occurred < or = 5 min in more than 80{\%} of the patients regardless of the number of twitches at the time of reversal drug administration.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Sugammadex, a modified gamma-cyclodextrin, is a selective relaxant-binding agent designed to reverse the effects of the steroidal neuromuscular blocking agents rocuronium or vecuronium. This study compared the efficacy of sugammadex and neostigmine for reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium for facilitating elective surgery. METHODS: This randomised, multicentre, parallel-group trial included 98 adult patients. Patients received intravenous propofol for induction followed by sevoflurane maintenance anaesthesia. Neuromuscular blockade was monitored using acceleromyography and a train-of-four (TOF) mode of stimulation. Patients were randomly allocated to receive sugammadex 2.0 mg kg(-1) or neostigmine 50 microg kg (-1) (with glycopyrrolate 10 microg kg(-1)) at reappearance of the second response of the TOF (mean 16{\%} twitch height of first response) after the last dose of rocuronium. Safety was evaluated by assessing adverse events, laboratory variables and vital signs. RESULTS: Time to recovery of the TOF ratio of 0.9 after sugammadex compared with neostigmine was significantly shorter (P < 0.0001), being 1.5 versus 18.6 min (geometric means). Predictability of response was greater with sugammadex than neostigmine: with 98{\%} of sugammadex patients versus 11{\%} of neostigmine patients recovering to a TOF ratio of 0.9 within 5 min. There were no clinical events related to residual neuromuscular blockade or reoccurrence of blockade. Serious adverse events were observed in two sugammadex-treated patients and in three neostigmine-treated patients, respectively, but none were considered related to study drugs. CONCLUSION: Sugammadex achieved significantly faster recovery of neuromuscular function after rocuronium to a TOF ratio of 0.9 compared with neostigmine (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00451217).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low degrees of residual paralysis (i.e., a train-of-four {$[$}TOF{$]$} ratio > 0.4) are relatively frequent, difficult to detect, and still potentially harmful. Unfortunately, the appropriate dose of anticholinesterase for this situation has not been determined. This may be of clinical interest because a high dose of neostigmine given at a shallow level of neuromuscular block may produce neuromuscular weakness. The purpose of this study was to investigate the dose-effect relationship of neostigmine to antagonize residual paralysis corresponding to a TOF ratio of 0.4 and 0.6. METHODS: Recovery after 10, 20, 30 microg/kg neostigmine or placebo given at either 0.4 or 0.6 TOF ratio was assessed by acceleromyography in 120 patients undergoing intravenous anesthesia. Time to a 0.9 and 1.0 TOF ratio was measured, and the probability of successful reversal within 10 min after the respective neostigmine doses was calculated. In addition, the dose of neostigmine needed to achieve the recovery targets in 5 or 10 min was also determined. RESULTS: When given at a TOF ratio of either 0.4 or 0.6, time to 0.9 and 1.0 TOF ratio was significantly shorter with any dose of neostigmine than without. The probability of successful reversal after 20 microg/kg neostigmine was 100{\%} when a TOF ratio of 0.9 was the target; for a TOF ratio of 1.0, the probability was 93{\%} and 67{\%}, dependent on whether the dose of neostigmine was given at TOF ratio of 0.6 or 0.4, respectively. With a dose of 30 microg/kg, a TOF ratio of 1.0 is expected to be reached within approximately 5 min. Low doses of neostigmine are required to reach a TOF ratio of 0.9 or to accept an interval of 10 min. CONCLUSION: Reduced doses (10-30 microg/kg) of neostigmine are effective in antagonizing shallow atracurium block. For successful reversal within 10 min, as little as 20 microg/kg neostigmine may be sufficient. These dose recommendations are specific for atracurium and an intravenous anesthetic background.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sugammadex, a specifically designed gamma-cyclodextrin, is a selective relaxant binding drug that rapidly reverses rocuronium-induced and, to a lesser extent, vecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade. In this study, we compared the efficacy of sugammadex and neostigmine for the reversal of vecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade in patients scheduled for elective surgery. METHODS: Patients aged > or = 18 yr, ASA Class I-III, and scheduled for a surgical procedure under sevoflurane/opioid anesthesia received an intubating dose of vecuronium (0.1 mg/kg) and maintenance doses of 0.02-0.03 mg/kg at reappearance of the second twitch (T(2)) of train-of-four (TOF) if required. Neuromuscular blockade was monitored using acceleromyography (TOF-Watch SX, Schering-Plough Ireland, Dublin, Ireland). At end of surgery, at reappearance of T(2) after the last dose of vecuronium, patients were randomized to receive either sugammadex (2 mg/kg) or neostigmine (50 microg/kg) plus glycopyrrolate (10 microg/kg) i.v.. The primary efficacy end-point was time from start of administration of sugammadex or neostigmine to recovery of TOF ratio to 0.9. RESULTS: The geometric mean time to recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.9 was significantly faster with sugammadex compared with neostigmine (2.7 min {$[$}95{\%} confidence interval {\{}CI{\}}{$]$}: 2.2-3.3) versus 17.9 min {$[$}95{\%} CI: 13.1-24.3{$]$}, respectively; P < 0.0001). The mean recovery times to a TOF ratio of 0.8 and 0.7 were also significantly shorter with sugammadex. No serious adverse events or unexpected side effects were reported with either drug. CONCLUSION: Sugammadex provided significantly faster reversal of vecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade compared with neostigmine.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether neostigmine 5 minutes after 0.4 mg/kg rocuronium accelerates reversal. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, comparative open-label study. SETTING: Operating room. PATIENTS: 60 ASA physical status I and II patients, aged 18 to 65 years. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received 0.4 mg/kg rocuronium during nitrous oxide (N(2)O)-propofol-opioid anesthesia. Reversal of neuromuscular blockade was achieved with neostigmine, either at 0.03 mg/kg or 0.05 mg/kg intravenously (IV), together with glycopyrrolate administered 5 minutes after relaxant and compared with spontaneous recovery. Onset, depth, and duration of neuromuscular block, as well as recovery of train-of-four (TOF) to 0.8 and 0.9 were evaluated. MAIN RESULTS: Times to achieve TOF ratios of 0.8 and 0.9 were significantly shorter when 0.03 mg/kg or 0.05 mg/kg neostigmine was administered 5 minutes after administration of rocuronium (20.2 $\pm$5 min and 22.6 $\pm$5.9 min or 17.8 $\pm$4.8 min and 19.4 $\pm$5.1 min, respectively) compared with controls (36.2 $\pm$8.5 min and 39.0 $\pm$8.7 min; P < 0.01). Duration to spontaneous T1 25{\%} recovery after rocuronium was 15.5 $\pm$6.5 min versus 9.3 $\pm$2.3 min and 7.7 $\pm$1.6 min in the treatment groups (P < 0.01). Recovery index (T1 from 25{\%} to 75{\%}) was significantly shorter after neostigmine (7.1 $\pm$2.4 min and 5.7 $\pm$4.0 min) versus controls (13.3 $\pm$8.3 min; P < 0.01). Speed of reversal did not differ significantly between IV neostigmine doses of 0.03 mg/kg or 0.05 mg/kg. CONCLUSION: Neostigmine accelerates recovery when administered 5 minutes after injection of IV rocuronium 0.4 mg/kg.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors cannot rapidly reverse profound neuromuscular block. Sugammadex, a selective relaxant binding agent, reverses the effects of rocuronium and vecuronium by encapsulation. This study assessed the efficacy of sugammadex compared with neostigmine in reversal of profound vecuronium-induced neuromuscular block under sevoflurane anesthesia. METHODS: Patients aged ≥18 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists class 1-4, scheduled to undergo surgery under general anesthesia were enrolled in this phase III, multicenter, randomized, safety-assessor blinded study. Sevoflurane anesthetized patients received vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg for intubation, with maintenance doses of 0.015 mg/kg as required. Patients were randomized to receive sugammadex 4 mg/kg or neostigmine 70 μg/kg with glycopyrrolate 14 μg/kg at 1-2 post-tetanic counts. The primary efficacy variable was time from start of study drug administration to recovery of the train-of-four ratio to 0.9. Safety assessments included physical examination, laboratory data, vital signs, and adverse events. RESULTS: Eighty three patients were included in the intent-to-treat population (sugammadex, n = 47; neostigmine, n = 36). Geometric mean time to recovery of the train-of-four ratio to 0.9 was 15-fold faster with sugammadex (4.5 minutes) compared with neostigmine (66.2 minutes; p < 0.0001) (median, 3.3 minutes with sugammadex versus 49.9 minutes with neostigmine). No serious drug-related adverse events occurred in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Recovery from profound vecuronium-induced block is significantly faster with sugammadex, compared with neostigmine. Neostigmine did not rapidly reverse profound neuromuscular block (Trial registration number: NCT00473694).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sugammadex shows a dose-response relationship for reversal of neuromuscular block (NMB) during propofol anaesthesia. Sevoflurane, unlike propofol, can prolong the effect of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs), increasing recovery time. This open-label, randomized, dose-finding trial explored sugammadex dose-response relationships, safety, and pharmacokinetics when administered for reversal of moderate rocuronium- or vecuronium-induced NMB during sevoflurane maintenance anaesthesia. METHODS: After anaesthesia induction with propofol, adult patients were randomized to receive single-dose rocuronium 0.9 mg kg⁻¹or vecuronium 0.1 mg kg⁻¹, with maintenance doses as needed. Anaesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane. NMB was monitored using acceleromyography. After the last dose of NMBA, at reappearance of T(2), single-dose sugammadex 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, or 4.0 mg kg⁻¹or placebo was administered. The primary efficacy variable was time from the start of sugammadex administration to recovery of T₄/T₁ratio to 0.9. Safety assessments were performed throughout. RESULTS: The per-protocol population comprised 93 patients (rocuronium, n=46; vecuronium, n=47). A statistically significant dose-response relationship was demonstrated for mean recovery times of T₄/T₁ratio to 0.9 with increasing sugammadex dose with both NMBAs: rocuronium, 96.3 min (placebo) to 1.5 min (sugammadex 4.0 mg kg⁻¹); vecuronium, 79.0 min (placebo) to 3.0 min (sugammadex 4.0 mg kg⁻¹). Plasma sugammadex concentrations indicated linear pharmacokinetics, independent of NMBA administered. No study drug-related serious adverse events occurred. Evidence of reoccurrence of block was reported in seven patients {$[$}sugammadex 0.5 mg kg⁻¹(suboptimal dose), n=6; 2.0 mg kg⁻¹, n=1{$]$}. CONCLUSIONS: During sevoflurane maintenance anaesthesia, sugammadex provides well-tolerated, effective, dose-dependent reversal of moderate rocuronium- and vecuronium-induced NMB.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Sugammadex effectively and rapidly reverses deep to moderate rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block. However, the required dose of sugammadex for smaller degrees of residual block is unknown. Therefore we investigated the efficacy of sugammadex and neostigmine at a train-of-four (TOF) ratio of 0.5. METHODS: After ethics committee (Munich, Germany) approval and written informed consent were obtained, 99 patients were anesthetized with propofol, remifentanil, and rocuronium. Neuromuscular monitoring was performed by calibrated electromyography. At recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.5, patients randomly received sugammadex (0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/kg), neostigmine (5, 8, 15, 25, or 40 μg/kg), or saline. The time between study drug injection, at TOF ratio of 0.5, and postoperative TOF ratio of 0.9 was measured. The dose-response relationship was analyzed with a biexponential model using the dose as the independent variable and the logarithm of the recovery time as the dependent variable. Effective doses were interpolated from regression models. RESULTS: Sugammadex, 0.22 mg/kg, is able to reverse a TOF ratio of 0.5 to 0.9 or higher in an average time of 2 min. Within 5 min, 95{\%} of patients reach this TOF ratio. Neostigmine, 34 μg/kg, is able to reverse a TOF ratio of 0.5 to 0.9 or higher within 5 min. No recurarization was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Sugammadex, 0.22 mg/kg, and neostigmine, 34 μg/kg, effectively and comparably reverse a rocuronium-induced shallow residual neuromuscular block at a TOF ratio of 0.5.},

@article{Adamus2011,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Extreme lateral interbody fusion (XLIF) is a method for stabilization of the lumbar spine. Intraoperatively, the surgeon identifies the lumbar nerve roots with a stimulator to prevent their injury. The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which shallow rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block must be intraoperatively reversed for reliable identification of nerve roots. METHODS: General anesthesia (midazolam-propofol-sufentanil-oxygen/air/sevoflurane-rocuronium) was administered to all patients. Train-of-four (TOF) stimulation of the ulnar nerve at 15-s intervals and electromyographic response of the adductor pollicis muscle were used. During operation, the surgeon stimulated the lumbar nerve roots (5-10 mA) to identify their course. At the appearance of two twitches to the TOF stimuli, sugammadex (2 mg/kg) or neostigmine (0.04 mg/kg) was administered. When the response to nerve root stimulation appeared, the TOF ratio was recorded. RESULTS: When the response to nerve root stimulation with 10 mA became detectable, the median (range) TOF ratios were 0.67 (0.50-0.81) and 0.65 (0.42-0.71) after sugammadex and neostigmine, respectively. Similarly, TOF ratios at the first detectable response to stimulation with 5 mA were 0.88 (0.67-0.93) and 0.83 (0.61-0.93). After sugammadex and neostigmine, the respective intervals until TOF ratio ≥0.90 were 2.0 (0.8-3.3) and 15.9 (7.3-28.8) min. CONCLUSION: Intraoperative reversal of shallow rocuronium-induced block with either sugammadex or neostigmine is an efficient method. For reliable detection of lumbar nerve roots with a stimulating current of 10 mA, the block should be reversed to a TOF ratio of at least 0.70. For a current intensity of 5 mA, the TOF ratio should reach 0.90.},

@article{Illman2011,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adequate recovery from neuromuscular block (NMB) is imperative for the patient to have full control of pharyngeal and respiratory muscles. The train-of-4 (TOF) ratio should return to at least 0.90 to exclude potentially clinically significant postoperative residual block. Fade cannot be detected reliably with a peripheral nerve stimulator (PNS) at a TOF ratio >0.4. The time gap between loss of visual fade by using a PNS until objective TOF ratio has returned to >0.90 can be considered "the potentially unsafe period of recovery." According to our hypothesis the duration of this period would be significantly shorter with sugammadex than with neostigmine. METHODS: Fifty patients received volatile anesthetics, opioids, and a rocuronium-induced NMB. TOF-Watch without a preload was used, but the anesthesiologist relied on visual evaluation of the TOF responses only. At end of operation, patients were randomized to receive either neostigmine 50 μg/kg or sugammadex 2 mg/kg, when 2 twitch responses were detected after the last dose of rocuronium. Timing of tracheal extubation was based on PNS and clinical data. Duration of the potentially unsafe period of recovery after reversal by either neostigmine or sugammadex was analyzed. Mann-Whitney U test and Pearson χ(2) test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The times {$[$}mean $\pm$sd (range){$]$} from loss of visual fade to TOF ratio >0.90 were 10.3 $\pm$5.5 (1.3 to 26.0) minutes and 0.3 $\pm$0.3 (0.0 to 1.0) minutes in the neostigmine and sugammadex groups, respectively (P < 0.001). The times from reversal by neostigmine or sugammadex to TOF ratio >0.90 were 13.3 $\pm$5.7 (3.5 to 28.9) and 1.7 $\pm$0.7 (0.7 to 3.5) minutes, respectively (P < 0.001). The values of TOF ratios at the time of loss of visual fade were 0.34 $\pm$0.14 (0.00 to 0.56) in patients given neostigmine and 0.86 $\pm$0.11 (0.64 to 1.04) in patients given sugammadex (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant time gap between visual loss of fade and return of TOF ratio >0.90 after reversal of a rocuronium block by neostigmine. Sugammadex in comparison with neostigmine allows a safer reversal of a moderate NMB when relying on visual evaluation of the TOF response.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There have been some conflicting reports showing that muscle relaxants and anticholinesterases affect the level of the bispectral index (BIS). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether pyridostigmine affects the level of the BIS during recovery from sevoflurane anesthesia. METHODS: Fifty-two adult patients scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy and laparoscopic appendectomy. Anesthesia was induced with thiopental 4 mg/kg and rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg. The lung was mechanically ventilated with 1-3 vol{\%} sevoflurane, 50{\%} oxygen and 50{\%} nitrous oxide. After a specimen was removed, the sevoflurane concentration was maintained at 1.5 vol{\%}. When skin closure began, sevoflurane was stopped; however, 50{\%} oxygen and 50{\%} nitrous oxide were maintained. The patients then received either (1) a group that received an injection of glycopyrrolate 0.04 mg/kg and pyridostigmine 0.2 mg/kg (reverse (R) group, n = 26) or (2) a group that received normal saline (control (C) group, n = 26). Group assignment was random. Pyridostigmine, a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor, is a parasympathomimetic. End-tidal sevoflurane concentration, train of four (TOF) ratio, bispectral index (BIS), blood pressure and heart rate were measured from the end of the operation to 15 min after inject of pyridostigmine or placebo. RESULTS: There were no significant between group differences in the time dependent decrease in end-tidal sevoflurane concentration (P = 0.0642). There were significant differences between the two groups for the time course for increases in the TOF value (P < 0.0001). There were significant differences between the two groups for the time course for increases in the BIS value (P = 0.0107). There were no significant differences in the mean BIS value up to 10 minutes after administering drug, but 15 minutes after administrating the reverse drug or the control drug, the BIS value showed significantly different BIS values: 68.2 $\pm$6.2 (Group R) and 63.2 $\pm$6.2 (Group C) (P = 0.0058). CONCLUSIONS: The finding that pyridostigmine increases TOF and BIS suggests that pyridostigmine may enhance recovery during recovery from sevoflurane anesthesia.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Residual paralysis is associated with post-operative pulmonary complications, including critical respiratory events. OBJECTIVE: We determined the incidence of critical respiratory events, such as hypoxaemia, in patients with minimal residual neuromuscular blockade and compared these data with those from patients with full recovery of blockade. DESIGN: Randomised, prospective, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Single centre; Rostock, Germany, from January 2007 to February 2008. PATIENTS: One hundred and thirty-two adult patients, aged 18-80 years, with the American Society of Anesthesiology I-III physical status, undergoing orthopaedic surgery under general anaesthesia, including rocuronium to produce neuromuscular blockade; 114 patients were randomised to one of two groups: neostigmine group (neostigmine 20 μg kg-1) or placebo group (saline). INTERVENTIONS: In the patients in the neostigmine group, the tracheal tube was removed at a train-of-four (TOF) ratio of 1.0; in the patients in the placebo group, the trachea was extubated at a TOF ratio less than 1.0, but without fade in TOF and double-burst stimulation (DBS). Neuromuscular monitoring was assessed simultaneously with qualitative TOF/DBS monitoring, and with quantitative calibrated acceleromyography. Critical respiratory events, such as hypoxaemia, were assessed in the post-anaesthesia care unit. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Forty-five patients (39.5{\%}) became hypoxaemic (SaO2 < 93{\%}); there was a significant difference between the groups (29 patients in the placebo group versus 16 in the neostigmine group; P = 0.021). RESULTS: In the neostigmine group, all patients were extubated at a TOF ratio of 1.0. In the placebo group, the median TOF ratio was 0.7 (range: 0.46-0.9; P < 0.001). The median time for spontaneous recovery in the placebo group was 16 min (range 3-49 min). Neostigmine 20 μg kg was effective in antagonising rocuronium-induced blockade without fade in TOF and DBS. CONCLUSION: In this randomised, prospective, placebo-controlled trial, minimal residual block was associated with hypoxaemia in the post-anaesthesia care unit. Neostigmine 20 μg kg was effective in antagonising rocuronium-induced (minimal) blockade.},

	abstract = {Six years ago, a study performed in our department reported that the incidence of postoperative residual curarisation (PORC) was 39{\%}. The reassessment of neuromuscular monitoring and reversal of neuromuscular block in routine anaesthetic practice is relevant now that sugammadex has become available. The incidence of PORC, defined by a train-of-four (TOF) <90{\%}, was evaluated at post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) arrival in patients whose neuromuscular block had been reversed with neostigmine or sugammadex and those in whom reversal was felt unnecessary (adequate spontaneous recovery). During the PACU stay we recorded the oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) at arrival, episodes of SpO(2) <90{\%}, airway manoeuvres and/or stimulation required to maintain SpO(2) >90{\%}, and the need for re-intubation. In total, 624 patients were studied. Fifteen percent (66/441) of the patients who were not reversed, 15{\%} (21/139) of those who were reversed with neostigmine and 2{\%} (1/44) of those who received sugammadex exhibited PORC (P=0.06). No patient required reintubation in the PACU. The absence of neuromuscular monitoring and pharmacological reversal before extubation were not associated with PORC. A TOF <90{\%} at PACU arrival was not associated with SpO(2) <90{\%} during the PACU stay. Body mass index was the only independent predictor of SpO(2) <90{\%} during the stay in the PACU. These findings indicate that in recent years, the incidence of PORC, defined by a TOF <90{\%}, has dramatically decreased in our institution. The differences in PORC were not statistically significant between patients who received sugammadex for reversal and patients with spontaneous recovery or neostigmine reversal.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Complete and fast recovery of neuromuscular function is very important in morbidly obese patients because of the possible influence of postoperative residual curarization (PORC) on respiratory function in the postoperative period. Recent reports underline incidences of the residual influence of neuromuscular blocking agents. METHODS: Seventy morbidly obese (BMI >40 kg m(-2)) patients requiring general anaesthesia and receiving rocuronium for muscle relaxation were randomly assigned into two groups: at the end of the anaesthetic procedure, one group received sugammadex 2 mg kg(-1) of corrected body weight (Group SUG) and the other group received neostigmine 0.05 mg kg(-1) of CBW (Group NEO). At the end of surgery and when response reached a train-of-four (TOF) score of 2, patients received the study drugs. The neuromuscular function was recorded and time to achieve 90{\%} of TOF (safe extubation) was measured. Patients were examined directly after arrival to the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) by a blinded investigator for the presence of PORC. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients received sugammadex and 35 neostigmine. Mean dose of rocuronium was 87.9 vs 85.6 mg (P>0.05), mean time to 90{\%} of TOF was 2.7 vs 9.6 min (P<0.05), and TOF at the PACU was 109.8{\%} vs 85.5{\%} (P<0.05) in Groups SUG and NEO, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of sugammadex provides fast recovery of neuromuscular function and prevents PORC in the morbidly obese, however neostigmine does not.},

	abstract = {Deep neuromuscular blockade during certain surgical procedures may improve operating conditions. Sugammadex can be used to reverse deep neuromuscular blockade without waiting for spontaneous recovery. This randomised study compared recovery times from neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium 0.6 mg.kg(-1), using sugammadex 4 mg.kg(-1) administered at 1-2 post-tetanic count (deep blockade) or neostigmine 50 μg.kg(-1) (plus atropine 10 μg.kg(-1)) administered at the re-appearance of the second twitch of a train-of-four stimulation (moderate blockade), in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. The primary efficacy variable was the time from the start of sugammadex/neostigmine administration to recovery of the train-of-four ratio to 0.9. Patients receiving sugammadex recovered 3.4 times faster than patients receiving neostigmine (geometric mean (95{\%} CI) recovery times of 2.4 (2.1-2.7) and 8.4 (7.2-9.8) min, respectively, p<0.0001). Moreover, 94{\%} (62/66) of sugammadex-treated patients recovered within 5 min, vs 20{\%} (13/65) of neostigmine-treated patients, despite the difference in the depth of neuromuscular blockade at the time of administration of both drugs. The ability to provide deep neuromuscular blockade throughout the procedure but still permit reversal at the end of surgery may enable improved surgical access and an enhanced visual field.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether use of intermediate acting neuromuscular blocking agents during general anesthesia increases the incidence of postoperative respiratory complications. DESIGN: Prospective, propensity score matched cohort study. SETTING: General teaching hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, United States, 2006-10. PARTICIPANTS: 18,579 surgical patients who received intermediate acting neuromuscular blocking agents during surgery were matched by propensity score to 18,579 reference patients who did not receive such agents. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were oxygen desaturation after extubation (hemoglobin oxygen saturation <90{\%} with a decrease in oxygen saturation after extubation of >3{\%}) and reintubations requiring unplanned admission to an intensive care unit within seven days of surgery. We also evaluated effects on these outcome variables of qualitative monitoring of neuromuscular transmission (train-of-four ratio) and reversal of neuromuscular blockade with neostigmine to prevent residual postoperative neuromuscular blockade. RESULTS: The use of intermediate acting neuromuscular blocking agents was associated with an increased risk of postoperative desaturation less than 90{\%} after extubation (odds ratio 1.36, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.23 to 1.51) and reintubation requiring unplanned admission to an intensive care unit (1.40, 1.09 to 1.80). Qualitative monitoring of neuromuscular transmission did not decrease this risk and neostigmine reversal increased the risk of postoperative desaturation less than 90{\%} (1.32, 1.20 to 1.46) and reintubation (1.76, 1.38 to 2.26). CONCLUSION: The use of intermediate acting neuromuscular blocking agents during anesthesia was associated with an increased risk of clinically meaningful respiratory complications. Our data suggest that the strategies used in our trial to prevent residual postoperative neuromuscular blockade should be revisited.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Morbidly obese (MO) patients are at increased risk for postoperative anesthesia-related complications. We evaluated the role of sugammadex versus neostigmine in the quality of recovery from profound rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade (NMB) in patients with morbid obesity. METHODS: We studied 40 female MO patients who received desflurane and remifentanil anesthesia for laparoscopic removal of adjustable gastric banding. NMB was achieved with rocuronium. At the end of the surgical procedure, complete reversal of NMB was obtained with sugammadex (SUG group, n = 20) or neostigmine plus atropine (NEO group, n = 20) in the presence of profound NMB. RESULTS: No difference in surgical time or anesthetic drugs was found between the groups. Anesthesia time was significantly greater in the NEO group than in the SUG group (95 $\pm$21 vs. 47.9 $\pm$6.4 min, p < 0.0001), which was mainly due to a longer time to reach a train-of-four ratio (TOFR) ≥0.9 in the NEO group (48.6 $\pm$18 vs. 3.1 $\pm$1.3 min, p < 0.0001) during reversal of profound NMB. Upon admission to the postanesthesia care unit, level of SpO2 (p = 0.018), TOFR (p < 0.0001), ability to swallow (p = 0.0027), and ability to get into bed independently (p = 0.022) were better in the SUG group than in the NEO group. Patients in the SUG group were discharged to the surgical ward earlier than patients in the NEO group were (p = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: Sugammadex allowed a safer and faster recovery from profound rocuronium-induced NMB than neostigmine did in patients with MO. Sugammadex may play an important role in fast-track bariatric anesthesia.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This 'real-life' study aimed to analyze the time from the start of neostigmine or sugammadex administration to recovery to a train of four ratio (TOFr) of 0.9 in a real-life in patients receiving rocuronium. The secondary aims were to assess the proportion of patients: presenting TOFr < 0.9 after 5, 10, and 20 min from reversal agent administration, receiving opioids for intraoperative analgesia and extubated in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). METHODS: This was a multisite, prospective, nonrandomized, observational real-life study. Reversal agent was administered at either T2 reappearance or at a post-tetanic count of 1 or 2. Drugs dosages were free according to each investigator's usual practice. RESULTS: Three hundred fifty-nine patients were enrolled onto the study. Time from reversal administration to TOFr to 0.9 is significantly faster in the sugammadex group than in the neostigmine group (shallow block: 2.2 vs. 6.9 min, respectively; P < 0.0001; deep block: 2.7 vs. 16.2 min, respectively; P < 0.0001). The number of patients with TOFr < 0.9 at 5, 10, and 20 min post-reversal agent administration was higher in the neostigmine than in the sugammadex group. Just five patients did not receive opioids. All patients were extubated in the operative room except for a single patient in the sugammadex group who was extubated following PACU admission. CONCLUSIONS: This real-life study confirms that reversal time is faster in patients receiving sugammadex than in those receiving neostigmine. TOFr < 0.9 20 min after reversal was only present in patients treated with neostigmine.},

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of low doses of neostigmine to antagonise shallow atracurium block during desflurane anaesthesia. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial, four groups. SETTING: Single centre, University Hospital, May 2010 to March 2011. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-eight American Society of Anesthesiologists I-III patients undergoing desflurane anaesthesia. INTERVENTION: At TOF ratio 0.6, patients were randomised to one of four treatments (physiological saline, 10, 20 or 30 µg kg(-1) neostigmine, n = 12 for each). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Primary efficacy endpoint: time interval between study drug injection and a TOF ratio more than 0.9 using acceleromyography. Secondary efficacy endpoint: neuromuscular recovery after 5 and 10 min. RESULTS: After physiological saline, the time interval {$[$}median (range){$]$} between a TOF ratio of 0.6 and 0.9 was 14 (7 to 18) min. After 10, 20 and 30 µg kg(-1) neostigmine, it was reduced to 5 (3 to 8) min, 5 (3 to 10) and 4 (2 to 6) min, respectively (P < 0.001 compared to physiological saline). At 5 min after physiological saline, the TOF ratio {$[$}mean (SD){$]$} was 0.73 (0.05) and 0.91 (0.06), 0.90 (0.10), 0.96 (0.02) after neostigmine 10, 20 or 30 µg kg(-1), respectively (P < 0.01 compared to physiological saline). At 10 min after physiological saline, the TOF ratio was 0.86 (0.08) and 1.0 (0), 0.98 (0.03), 1.0 (0) after neostigmine 10, 20 or 30 µg kg(-1), respectively (P < 0.01 compared to physiological saline). CONCLUSION: Under desflurane anaesthesia, neostigmine 10 µg kg(-1) is effective in antagonising shallow atracurium block. Compared to no neostigmine, the time to a TOF ratio more than 0.9 was shortened and neuromuscular recovery at 5 and 10 min was more advanced. TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT Nr. is 2009 -018214-19.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Japan, routine clinical care does not normally involve the use of a monitoring device to guide the administration of neuromuscular blocking drugs or their antagonists. Although most previous reports demonstrate that sugammadex offers more rapid and reliable antagonism from rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade, this advantage has not been confirmed in clinical settings when no neuromuscular monitoring is used. In this multicenter observational study, we sought to determine whether sugammadex reduces the incidence of postoperative residual weakness compared with neostigmine when the administration of rocuronium and its antagonists is not guided by neuromuscular monitoring. METHODS: This study was conducted in two 5-month periods that preceded and followed the introduction of sugammadex into clinical practice in Japan. Five university-affiliated teaching hospitals participated in this study. Neostigmine was used to antagonize rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade in the first phase, and sugammadex was used in the second phase. The timing and doses of rocuronium, neostigmine, and sugammadex were determined by the attending anesthesiologists without the use of neuromuscular function monitoring devices. To ascertain the incidence of postoperative residual neuromuscular weakness, the train-of-four ratio (TOFR) was determined acceleromyographically after tracheal extubation. Since our practice also does not usually involve calibration and normalization of accelerographic responses, both TOFR <0.9 and TOFR <1.0 were used as the criteria for defining postoperative residual weakness. RESULTS: In the first phase, 109 patients received neostigmine (average dose 33 µg/kg) and 23 patients were considered (by clinical criteria) to have adequate recovery and did not receive neostigmine (spontaneous recovery group). In the second phase, 117 patients received sugammadex (average dose 2.7 mg/kg) for antagonism of rocuronium-induced blockade. The incidence (95{\%} confidence interval) of TOFR <0.9 under spontaneous recovery, after neostigmine, and after sugammadex, was 13.0{\%} (2.8{\%}-33.6{\%}), 23.9{\%} (16.2{\%}-33.0{\%}), and 4.3{\%} (1.7{\%}-9.4{\%}), respectively. The incidence (95{\%} confidence interval) of TOFR <1.0 in these groups was 69.6{\%} (47.1{\%}-86.6{\%}), 67.0{\%} (57.3{\%}-75.7{\%}), and 46.2{\%} (36.9{\%}-55.6{\%}), respectively. The use of sevoflurane in the neostigmine group and the short interval between the administration of the last doses of rocuronium and sugammadex were associated with a higher incidence of postoperative residual weakness. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the risk of TOFR <0.9 after tracheal extubation after sugammadex remains as high as 9.4{\%} in a clinical setting in which neuromuscular monitoring (objective or subjective) was not used. Our finding underscores the importance of neuromuscular monitoring even when sugammadex is used for antagonism of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this prospective audit was to investigate clinical practice related to muscle relaxant reversal and the impact made by the recent introduction of sugammadex on patient outcome at a tertiary teaching hospital. METHODS: Data from all patients intubated at our institution during two epochs of seven consecutive days each was collected prospectively. Directly prior to extubation, the train-of-four (TOF) ratio was assessed quantitatively by an independent observer. Postoperative outcome parameters were complications in the recovery room and radiological diagnosed atelectasis or pneumonia within 30 days. RESULTS: Data from 146 patients were analysed. Three reversal strategies were used: no reversal, neostigmine or sugammadex. The TOF ratio was less than 0.7 in 17 patients (nine no reversal, eight neostigmine) and less than 0.9 in 47 patients (24 no reversal, 19 neostigmine, four sugammadex). Those reversed with sugammadex showed fewer episodes of postoperative oxygen desaturation (15{\%} vs. 33{\%}; P<0.05). TOF ratios of less than 0.7 (P<0.05) and also <0.9 (P<0.01) were more likely associated with X-ray results consistent with postoperative atelectasis or pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a significant impact of residual paralysis on patient outcome. The use of sugammadex resulted in the lowest incidence of residual paralysis.},

@article{Pongracz2013,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Doses of sugammadex required to reverse deep, moderate, and shallow rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade have been established. However, no adequate doses for the reversal of reappearance of four twitches of train-of-four (TOF) stimulation (threshold TOF-count-four) have been established. METHODS: This single-center, randomized, controlled, double-blind, four-groups parallel-arm study included 80 patients undergoing general anesthesia with propofol, sevoflurane, fentanyl, and rocuronium. Neuromuscular monitoring was performed with calibrated acceleromyography. Once rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade recovered spontaneously to threshold TOF-count-four, patients randomly received 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 mg/kg of sugammadex or 0.05 mg/kg of neostigmine. The time between study drug injection and reversal of TOF ratios to 1.0 was measured. Rapid reversal (≤2.0 min average, upper limit of 5.0 min) was the primary endpoint and slower reversal (≤5.0 min average, upper limit of 10 min) was the secondary endpoint of the study. RESULTS: Sugammadex, in doses of 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg, reversed threshold TOF-count-four to TOF ratios of 1.0 in 2.1$\pm$0.8 min (mean$\pm$SD) and 1.8$\pm$0.9 min, respectively. Sugammadex, 0.5 mg/kg, induced a similar degree of reversal in 4.1$\pm$1.9 min (P<0.001 vs. 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg). Neostigmine, 0.05 mg/kg, reversed TOF ratios to 1.0 in 8.5$\pm$3.5 min (P<0.001 vs. sugammadex groups). CONCLUSION: Sugammadex, 1.0 mg/kg, rapidly and effectively reverses rocuronium-induced block that has recovered spontaneously to a threshold TOF-count-four. A dose of 0.5 mg/kg was equally effective, but satisfactory antagonism took as long as 8 min to take place.},

@article{Quillfeldt2013,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This institutional anaesthetic practice evaluation compared patient safety with respect to residual neuromuscular blockade (NMB) at the time of tracheal extubation in patients undergoing high-risk eye surgery. METHODS: Two muscle relaxation regimens were compared: rocuronium administered via intravenous (i.v.) bolus dosing combined with reversal through sugammadex at end of surgery (group R/S; 17 patients); mivacurium administered via continuous i.v. infusion without antagonization (group M; 22 patients). Train-of-four (TOF) monitoring determined the depth of NMB. RESULTS: The TOF ratio at the time of tracheal extubation was greater in group R/S (median 1.03) than in group M (median 0.62). Time from end of surgery to tracheal extubation was not significantly different. The surgeons were 100{\%} satisfied with the working conditions provided under both relaxation regimens. CONCLUSIONS: Residual postoperative curarization at the time of extubation was frequently observed in group M, whereas there was complete recovery in group R/S. Reversal of NMB by sugammadex provides an additional safety dimension to patient care and should thus be considered especially for those at risk of airway complications or aspiration, in addition to frail patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rapid and complete reversal of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) is desirable at the end of surgery. Sugammadex reverses rocuronium-induced NMB by encapsulation. It is well tolerated in Caucasian patients, providing rapid reversal of moderate (reappearance of T2) rocuronium-induced NMB. We investigated the efficacy and safety of sugammadex versus neostigmine in Korean patients. METHODS: This randomized, safety assessor-blinded trial (NCT01050543) included Korean patients undergoing general anesthesia. Rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg was given prior to intubation with maintenance doses of 0.1-0.2 mg/kg as required. Patients received sugammadex 2.0 mg/kg or neostigmine 50 µg/kg with glycopyrrolate 10 µg/kg to reverse the NMB at the reappearance of T2, after the last rocuronium dose. The primary efficacy endpoint was the time from sugammadex or neostigmine administration to recovery of the train-of-four (TOF) ratio to 0.9. The safety of these medications was also assessed. RESULTS: Of 128 randomized patients, 118 had evaluable data (n = 59 in each group). The geometric mean (95{\%} confidence interval) time to recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.9 was 1.8 (1.6, 2.0) minutes in the sugammadex group and 14.8 (12.4, 17.6) minutes in the neostigmine group (P < 0.0001). Sugammadex was generally well tolerated, with no evidence of residual or recurrence of NMB; four patients in the neostigmine group reported adverse events possibly indicative of inadequate NMB reversal. CONCLUSIONS: Sugammadex was well tolerated and provided rapid reversal of moderate rocuronium-induced NMB in Korean patients, with a recovery time 8.1 times faster than neostigmine. These results are consistent with those reported for Caucasian patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quality of postoperative recovery is an important outcome after surgery. An observational cohort study was designed to assess the quality of postoperative recovery using the Portuguese version of the Postoperative Quality Recovery Scale (PQRS) in patients treated with neostigmine vs. sugammadex as neuromuscular blocking reversal agents. METHODS: A convenience sample of 101 adult patients undergoing elective surgery with general anaesthesia and treated with neostigmine (n=48) or sugammadex (n=53) as neuromuscular blocking reversal agents was included. Patients were evaluated using the Portuguese PQRS version at baseline and postoperatively at 15 (T15) and 40 (T40) min and also at days 1 and 3. Recovery was defined as return to baseline values (or better) at each time points. RESULTS: The PQRS overall recovery rates were similar in both groups, but recoveries in the nociceptive (96.2{\%} vs. 81.3{\%}, P=0.02) and physiological (96.2{\%} vs. 70.2{\%}, P=0.001) domains at T40 were higher in the sugammadex group than in the neostigmine group. Also, there was a trend that patients treated with sugammadex reported significantly better global perspective on the impact of surgery on working capacity and daily activities, as well as higher satisfaction with anaesthetic care. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that sugammadex may improve physiological and nociceptive postoperative recovery as well as patient satisfaction with anaesthetic care. Although we lack an explanation for a possible favourable impact of sugammadex on quality of recovery, our results may provide sufficient preliminary data to justify a randomised trial to explore this possibility.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade (RNMB) is associated with significant morbidity. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this retrospective data analysis was to investigate the influence of the method of RNMB reversal on postoperative outcome. SETTING: Tertiary teaching hospital in Western Australia. PATIENTS: With Ethics Committee approval, data from 1444 patients who received at least one dose of a non-depolarising muscle relaxant intraoperatively during 2011 were analysed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Endpoints included unwanted events in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU); symptoms of pulmonary complications within 7 postoperative days (0 to 100 outcome score based on 'temperature >38$\,^{\circ}$C', 'leucocyte count >11 ×10 l', 'physical examination consistent with pneumonia' and 'shortness of breath'); PACU turnover time; and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Data from 1444 patients (722 sugammadex, 212 neostigmine and 510 no-reversal) were analysed. The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in PACU was higher in neostigmine-reversed than sugammadex-reversed patients (21.5 vs. 13.6{\%}; P <0.05). No differences were found regarding other PACU incidents, length of PACU stay or hospital stay. Pulmonary outcome deteriorated significantly (outcome score increased) with age and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status. This was observed particularly in ASA 3/4 patients more than 60 years of age in neostigmine-reversed or non-reversed patients, but almost no detrimental effect of age on pulmonary outcome was found in the sugammadex group (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: RNMB reversal with sugammadex was associated with the lowest rate of PONV and may reduce the risk of pulmonary complications in elderly ASA 3/4 patients.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Bariatric surgery patients are at high risk of perioperative respiratory adverse events. We hypothesized that the use of sugammadex to reverse neuromuscular blockade could improve postoperative respiratory outcomes. METHODS: Prospective observational series of consecutive patients scheduled for laparoscopic bariatric surgery in whom neuromuscular blockade was reverted with sugammadex were compared with a historical matched cohort of patients reverted with neostigmines. The necessity of postoperative mechanical ventilation or pathological changes in postoperative chest X-ray were two of the comparisons done. RESULTS: We enrolled 160 patients in each group (Sugammadex - SG and Historical - HG). Two patients (mean, CI 95{\%}), (1.25, 0.34-4.4) in the SG and five patients in the HG (mean, CI 95{\%}), (3.13, 1.34-7.11) required mechanical ventilation immediately after surgery (p=0.38, chi-square test). Significantly less chest X-ray postoperative changes were observed in the SG: 11 patients (6.9{\%}) versus 26 patients (16.3{\%}) in the HG (Odds ratio OR, CI 95{\%}) (0.36, 0.18-0.8). CONCLUSION: Requirement of mechanical ventilation is not associated to the reversal agent employed. Less pathological postoperative chest X-ray changes were found in the group of patients whose neuromuscular blockade was reverted with sugammadex.},

@article{Martini2014,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The routine use of neuromuscular blocking agents reduces the occurrence of unacceptable surgical conditions. In some surgeries, such as retroperitoneal laparoscopies, deep neuromuscular block (NMB) may further improve surgical conditions compared with moderate NMB. In this study, the effect of deep NMB on surgical conditions was assessed. METHODS: Twenty-four patients undergoing elective laparoscopic surgery for prostatectomy or nephrectomy were randomized to receive moderate NMB (train-of-four 1-2) using the combination of atracurium/mivacurium, or deep NMB (post-tetanic count 1-2) using high-dose rocuronium. After surgery, NMB was antagonized with neostigmine (moderate NMB), or sugammadex (deep NMB). During all surgeries, one surgeon scored the quality of surgical conditions using a five-point surgical rating scale (SRS) ranging from 1 (extremely poor conditions) to 5 (optimal conditions). Video images were obtained and 12 anaesthetists rated a random selection of images. RESULTS: Mean (standard deviation) SRS was 4.0 (0.4) during moderate and 4.7 (0.4) during deep NMB (P<0.001). Moderate block resulted in 18{\%} of scores at the low end of the scale (Scores 1-3); deep block resulted in 99{\%} of scores at the high end of the scale (Scores 4 and 5). Cardiorespiratory conditions were similar during and after surgery in both groups. Between anaesthetists and surgeon, there was poor agreement between scores of individual images (average κstatistic 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Application of the five-point SRS showed that deep NMB results in an improved quality of surgical conditions compared with moderate block in retroperitoneal laparoscopies, without compromise to the patients' peri- and postoperative cardiorespiratory conditions.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We aimed to compare clinical effects of sugammadex versus combination of anticholinergic-anticholinesterase agents for reversing of nondepolarizing neuromuscular block in pediatric patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 60 pediatric patients whom should be performed general anesthesia in the supine position were enrolled to this randomized double-blinded clinical trial. Fentanyl 1 μg/kg, propofol 2 mg/kg, rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg were used in induction and sevofluran, 50{\%} O2-50{\%} N2O in maintenance of anesthesia. Neuromuscular conductions were assessed by train of four (TOF)-Watch SX (Organon, Schering-Plough, Ireland) acceleromyograph. Patients were intubated at the moment of TOF 0. At the end of the operation emergence of T2 point was replied by 2 mg/kg sugammadex administration in group 1 and 0.06 mg/kg neostigmine +0.02 mg/kg atropine in group 2. At the moment of T0.9 inhalation, gases were ceased, and patients were extubated. Hemodynamic alterations, access to T0.9, extubation time, recovery parameters, drug consumptions and adverse effects were recorded. RESULTS: Train of four scores showed a lesser increase in group 2 than group 1 from 15(th) s to 30(th) min during post reverse period (from 6.9 $\pm$6.4 to 91.7 $\pm$7.2 in group 2 vs. from 35.4 $\pm$21.4 to 99.5 $\pm$1.0 in group 1) (p < 0.0004). Group 1 patients exhibited much more complete muscle strength rates than group 2 (P < 0.001). T0.9 and extubation times were significantly longer in group 2 than group 1 (P < 0.001). Comparison of adverse effects yielded no difference. CONCLUSION: Sugammadex can be considered as a safe agent in order to reverse neuromuscular block in pediatric patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies show a prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time in healthy volunteers after treatment with sugammadex. The authors investigated the effect of sugammadex on postsurgical bleeding and coagulation variables. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind trial enrolled patients receiving thromboprophylaxis and undergoing hip or knee joint replacement or hip fracture surgery. Patients received sugammadex 4 mg/kg or usual care (neostigmine or spontaneous recovery) for reversal of rocuronium- or vecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method, stratified by thromboprophylaxis and renal status, was used to estimate relative risk and 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) of bleeding events with sugammadex versus usual care. Safety was further evaluated by prespecified endpoints and adverse event reporting. RESULTS: Of 1,198 patients randomized, 1,184 were treated (sugammadex n = 596, usual care n = 588). Bleeding events within 24 h (classified by an independent, blinded Adjudication Committee) were reported in 17 (2.9{\%}) sugammadex and 24 (4.1{\%}) usual care patients (relative risk {$[$}95{\%} CI{$]$}, 0.70 {$[$}0.38 to 1.29{$]$}). Compared with usual care, increases of 5.5{\%} in activated partial thromboplastin time (P < 0.001) and 3.0{\%} in prothrombin time (P < 0.001) from baseline with sugammadex occurred 10 min after administration and resolved within 60 min. There were no significant differences between sugammadex and usual care for other blood loss measures (transfusion, 24-h drain volume, drop in hemoglobin, and anemia), or risk of venous thromboembolism, and no cases of anaphylaxis. CONCLUSION: Sugammadex produced limited, transient (<1 h) increases in activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time but was not associated with increased risk of bleeding versus usual care.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study compared efficacy and safety of the selective relaxant binding agent sugammadex (2 mg/kg) with neostigmine (50 μg/kg) for neuromuscular blockade (NMB) reversal in Chinese and Caucasian subjects. METHODS: This was a randomized, active-controlled, multicenter, safety-assessor-blinded study (NCT00825812) in American Society of Anesthesiologists Class 1-3 subjects undergoing surgery with propofol anesthesia. Rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg was administered for endotracheal intubation, with 0.1-0.2 mg/kg maintenance doses given as required. NMB was monitored using TOF-Watch({\textregistered}) SX. At second twitch reappearance, after last rocuronium dose, subjects received sugammadex 2 mg/kg or neostigmine 50 μg/kg plus atropine 10-20 μg/kg, according to randomization. Primary efficacy variable was time from sugammadex/neostigmine to recovery of the train-of-four (TOF) ratio to 0.9. RESULTS: Overall, 230 Chinese subjects (sugammadex, n = 119, neostigmine, n = 111); and 59 Caucasian subjects (sugammadex, n = 29, neostigmine, n = 30) had evaluable data. Geometric mean (95{\%} CI) time to recovery to TOF ratio 0.9 was 1.6 (1.5-1.7) min with sugammadex vs 9.1 (8.0-10.3) min with neostigmine in Chinese subjects. Corresponding times for Caucasian subjects were 1.4 (1.3-1.5) min and 6.7 (5.5-8.0) min, respectively. Sugammadex 2 mg/kg was generally well tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported. There was no residual NMB or recurrence of NMB. CONCLUSION: Both Chinese and Caucasian subjects recovered from NMB significantly faster after sugammadex 2 mg/kg vs neostigmine 50 μg/kg, with a \~{}5.7 times (p < 0.0001) faster recovery with sugammadex vs neostigmine in Chinese subjects.

@article{Brueckmann2015,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate whether reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade with sugammadex reduced the incidence of residual blockade and facilitated operating room discharge readiness. METHODS: Adult patients undergoing abdominal surgery received rocuronium, followed by randomized allocation to sugammadex (2 or 4 mg kg(-1)) or usual care (neostigmine/glycopyrrolate, dosing per usual care practice) for reversal of neuromuscular blockade. Timing of reversal agent administration was based on the providers' clinical judgement. Primary endpoint was the presence of residual neuromuscular blockade at PACU admission, defined as a train-of-four (TOF) ratio <0.9, using TOF-Watch{\textregistered}SX. Key secondary endpoint was time between reversal agent administration and operating room discharge-readiness; analysed with analysis of covariance. RESULTS: Of 154 patients randomized, 150 had a TOF value measured at PACU entry. Zero out of 74 sugammadex patients and 33 out of 76 (43.4{\%}) usual care patients had TOF-Watch SX-assessed residual neuromuscular blockade at PACU admission (odds ratio 0.0, 95{\%} CI {$[$}0-0.06{$]$}, P<0.0001). Of these 33 usual care patients, 2 also had clinical evidence of partial paralysis. Time between reversal agent administration and operating room discharge-readiness was shorter for sugammadex vs usual care (14.7 vs. 18.6 min respectively; P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: After abdominal surgery, sugammadex reversal eliminated residual neuromuscular blockade in the PACU, and shortened the time from start of study medication administration to the time the patient was ready for discharge from the operating room.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sugammadex is a novel neuromuscular reversal agent, but its associated hypersensitivity reaction and high cost have been obstacles to its widespread use. In the interest of reducing the necessary dosage of sugammadex, the reversal time of the combined use of sugammadex and neostigmine from moderate neuromuscular blockade were investigated. METHODS: The patients enrolled ranged in age from 18 to 65 years old with American Society of Anesthesiologists class 1 or 2. The subjects were randomly assigned into one of the four groups (Group S2, S1, SN, and N; n = 30 per group). The reversal agents of each groups were as follows: S2 - sugammadex 2 mg/kg, S1 - sugammadex 1 mg/kg, SN - sugammadex 1 mg/kg + neostigmine 50 µg/kg + glycopyrrolate 10 µg/kg, N - neostigmine 50 µg/kg + glycopyrrolate 10 µg/kg. The time to recovery of the train-of-four (TOF) ratio was checked in each group. RESULTS: The time to 90{\%} recovery of TOF ratio was 182.6 $\pm$88.9, 371.1 $\pm$210.4, 204.3 $\pm$103.2, 953.2 $\pm$379.7 sec in group S2, S1, SN and N, respectively. Group SN showed a significantly shorter recovery time than did group S1 and N (P < 0.001). However, statistically significant differences between the S2 and SN groups were not be observed (P = 0.291). No hypersensitivity reactions occurred in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: For the reversal from rocuronium-induced moderate neuromuscular blockade, the combined use of sugammadex and neostigmine may be helpful to decrease the recovery time and can also reduce the required dosage of sugammadex. However, the increased incidence of systemic muscarinic side effects must be considered.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative recurarization remains a risk following the use of the conventional neuromuscular blocking agents. In addition, none of the commonly used reversal agents, such as neostigmine or edrophonium are capable of reliably reversing profound blockade. The present comparative and randomized study investigated the use of sugammadex for reversing profound neuromuscular blockade (NMB) in pediatric neurosurgical patients undergone posterior fossa tumor excision. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty pediatric patients undergoing elective craniotomy for posterior fossa tumor excision were randomly divided into either of neostigmine or sugammadex group in which muscle relaxant was reversed at the end of anesthesia either with neostigmine 0.04 mg/kg added to atropine 0.02 mg/kg or sugammadex 4 mg/kg alone, respectively. The primary endpoint was the time from the administration of sugammadex or neostigmine to recovery of the train of four (TOF) ratio to 90{\%} after rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block. Unpaired t-test was used to compare continuous variables between groups. Meanwhile, repeated ANOVA was used to detect intragroup differences. RESULTS: Patients in sugammadex group attained a TOF ratio 90{\%} in statistically shorter time (1.4 $\pm$1.2 min) than those in neostigmine group (25.16 $\pm$6.49 min) for reversal of the rocuronium. Mean arterial pressure and heart rate were significantly higher in neostigmine group at 2, 5 and 10 min after administration of the reversal agents and returned nonsignificantly different after that. With no recurarization in any patient throughout the study period. CONCLUSION: Sugammadex rapidly and effectively reverses rocuronium-induced NMB in pediatric patients undergoing neurosurgery when administered at reappearance of T2 of TOF at dose 4 mg/kg.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol and remifentanil is widely used in neuroanaesthesiology and enables the quick recovery and early neurological assessment of patients. The administration of muscle relaxants carries a risk of residual relaxation following surgery. The administration of a suitable dose of sugammadex reverses the neuromuscular block irrespective of its depth and has none of the side effects associated with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the usefulness of sugammadex for the reversal of vecuronium-induced effects following intracranial surgery. METHODS: The study involved 38 women who underwent supratentorial tumour removal. These women were randomly divided into two groups. Total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol and remifentanil using target-controlled infusion was administered according to the Schnider and Minto models, respectively. Endotracheal intubation was performed after the target concentrations of propofol and remifentanil reached 4 μg mL⁻¹and 4 ng mL⁻¹, respectively. Vecuronium (100 μg kg⁻¹) was administered, and no response to TOF stimulation was observed. Relaxation was continued via the continuous infusion of vecuronium (0.8-1.2 μg kg⁻¹min⁻¹) to provide a TOF of 2 throughout the surgery. In group I, neuromuscular conduction was restored with intravenous sugammadex (2 mg kg⁻¹), whereas in group II, no reversal agents were administered. RESULTS: The times of the return of spontaneous breathing, extubation, eye opening (both spontaneous and in response to a verbal command) were found to be longer in group II than group I. CONCLUSION: The use of sugammadex following craniotomy accelerates the achievement of optimal extubation conditions.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the new selective binding agent sugammadex causes less postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) than the cholinesterase inhibitor neostigmine. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blinded study. SETTING: University-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS: One hundred American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 1 and 2 patients scheduled for extremity surgery. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to neostigmine (70 μg/kg) and atropine (0.4 mg per mg neostigmine) or sugammadex 2 mg/kg for neuromuscular antagonism at the end of anesthesia, when 4 twitches in response to train-of-four stimulation were visible with fade. MEASUREMENTS: We recorded PONV, recovery parameters, antiemetic consumption, and side effects. MAIN RESULTS: Nausea and vomiting scores were lower in the sugammadex patients upon arrival in the postanesthesia care unit (med: 0 {$[$}min-max, 0-3{$]$} vs med: 0 {$[$}min-max, 0-3{$]$}; P < .05), but thereafter low and comparable. Postoperative antiemetic and analgesic consumption were similar in each group. Extubation (median {$[$}interquartile range{$]$}, 3 {$[$}1-3.25{$]$} vs 4 {$[$}1-3.25{$]$}; P < .001) first eye opening (4 {$[$}3-7.25{$]$} vs 7 {$[$}5-11{$]$}; P < .001), and head lift (4 {$[$}2-7.25{$]$} vs 8 {$[$}11-25{$]$}; P < .001) in minutes were shorter in patients given sugammadex. Postoperative heart rates were significantly lower in all measured times patients given neostigmine. CONCLUSIONS: Nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking antagonism with sugammadex speeds recovery of neuromuscular strength but only slightly and transiently reduces PONV compared with neostigmine and atropine.},

@article{McLean2015,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Duration of action increases with repeated administration of neuromuscular-blocking agents, and intraoperative use of high doses of neuromuscular-blocking agent may affect respiratory safety. METHODS: In a hospital-based registry study on 48,499 patients who received intermediate-acting neuromuscular-blocking agents, the authors tested the primary hypothesis that neuromuscular-blocking agents are dose dependently associated with the risk of postoperative respiratory complications. In the secondary analysis, the authors evaluated the association between neostigmine dose given for reversal of neuromuscular-blocking agents and respiratory complications. Post hoc, the authors evaluated the effects of appropriate neostigmine reversal (neostigmine ≤60 μg/kg after recovery of train-of-four count of 2) on respiratory complications. The authors controlled for patient-, anesthesia-, and surgical complexity-related risk factors. RESULTS: High doses of neuromuscular-blocking agents were associated with an increased risk of postoperative respiratory complications (n = 644) compared with low doses (n = 205) (odds ratio {$[$}OR{$]$}, 1.28; 95{\%} CI, 1.04 to 1.57). Neostigmine was associated with a dose-dependent increase in the risk of postoperative respiratory complications (OR, 1.51; 95{\%} CI, 1.25 to 1.83). Post hoc analysis revealed that appropriate neostigmine reversal eliminated the dose-dependent association between neuromuscular-blocking agents and respiratory complications (for neuromuscular-blocking agent effects with appropriate reversal: OR, 0.98; 95{\%} CI, 0.63 to 1.52). CONCLUSIONS: The use of neuromuscular-blocking agents was dose dependently associated with increased risk of postoperative respiratory complications. Neostigmine reversal was also associated with a dose-dependent increase in the risk of respiratory complications. However, the exploratory data analysis suggests that the proper use of neostigmine guided by neuromuscular transmission monitoring results can help eliminate postoperative respiratory complications associated with the use of neuromuscular-blocking agents.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Notification of sugammadex has been supplemented with a section on hemostasis, including a longer clotting time in the first minutes following injection, without any documented clinical consequences. The objective of this observational study was to analyze the effects of sugammadex administration on routine coagulation tests and bleeding in the clinical setting. METHODS: After Institutional Review Board approval, a prospective observational study was conducted between January and December 2011. Adult patients scheduled for laparotomies were analyzed in groups according to the type of reversal (without sugammadex versus 2 or 4 mg/kg sugammadex). There were no changes in our current clinical practice. Blood samples drawn from these patients were standardized at the same time and tested using the same daily calibrated machine. The endpoint was a comparison of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), hemoglobin (Hb) level and hematocrit (Ht), immediately before sugammadex administration (H0) and 1 h after neuromuscular block reversal (H1). RESULTS: One hundred and forty-two patients in three groups were included as follows: 11 in the "without sugammadex" group, 64 in the "2 mg/kg sugammadex" group and 67 in the "4 mg/kg sugammadex" group. Results did not differ significantly among the groups. CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective observational study, the use of 2 and 4 mg/kg sugammadex was not associated with a longer clotting time or decreased hemoglobin concentrations. Future prospective investigations should study patients receiving 16 mg/kg sugammadex and/or with abnormal coagulation tests.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Deep neuromuscular blockade (NMB) may not always be maintained to the end of surgery and the depth of block may be allowed to gradually diminish over time, particularly if reversal of NMB is not routinely performed. AIM: The current study aimed to assess recovery from deep rocuronium-induced NMB with sugammadex compared with placebo, provide data regarding the extent of residual blockade after deep rocuronium-induced NMB (placebo group), and to determine whether complete and reliable recovery could be provided by sugammadex (sugammadex group). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, safety-assessor-blinded study in adult patients of American Society of Anesthesiologists Class I to III. Patients with clinically relevant kidney or liver insufficiency were excluded. Anesthesia was administered as routinely practiced at each study site. Rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg was administered for intubation, with maintenance doses of 0.1-0.2 mg/kg as needed. After the last rocuronium dose, at deep NMB (target depth 1-2 post-tetanic counts), patients received a single dose of sugammadex 4.0 mg/kg or placebo as randomized. The primary endpoint was time from sugammadex or placebo administration to recovery of the train-of-four (TOF) ratio to 0.9. Safety was assessed through monitoring of adverse events, vital signs and physical examination. Patients were also assessed for evidence of residual or recurrence of NMB. With this design, the study will provide data regarding the extent of residual blockade under these conditions (placebo group), and determine whether complete and reliable recovery could be provided by sugammadex (sugammadex group). RESULTS: Recovery to a TOF ratio of ≥0.9 with sugammadex was significantly faster (\~{} 40 times) than spontaneous recovery: geometric mean (95 {\%} confidence interval) times were 2.2 (1.9-2.5) and 89.8 (80.1-100.7) min, respectively (p < 0.0001, N = 134); maximum spontaneous recovery was 289.8 min. Safety was comparable between groups, with no recurrence of blockade. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms a prolonged residual blockade in patients who did not receive sugammadex, with median time to recovery > 1.5 h in the placebo group and one patient taking 4.8 h to achieve a safe level of neuromuscular function recovery following deep NMB. In contrast, sugammadex provided complete and reliable recovery of neuromuscular function (median time to recovery of 2.0 min). Thus, deep NMB with rocuronium until the end of the operation may be possible in combination with sugammadex reversal.},

This recovery time was significantly shorter when reversal was given at loss of fade to double-burst stimulation (c), than when given at the appearance of the fourth twitch (a), p = 0.046. However, the total time to extubation may be unaffected as it takes longer for fade to be lost after double-burst stimulation than for four twitches subjectively to appear.},

@article{Tassonyi2015,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pipecuronium is a steroidal neuromuscular blocking agent. Sugammadex, a relaxant binding γ-cyclodextrin derivative, reverses the effect of rocuronium, vecuronium, and pancuronium. We investigated whether sugammadex reverses moderate pipecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade (NMB) and the doses required to achieve reversal. METHODS: This single-center, randomized, double-blind, 5-group parallel-arm study comprised 50 patients undergoing general anesthesia with propofol, sevoflurane, fentanyl, and pipecuronium. Neuromuscular monitoring was performed with acceleromyography (TOF-Watch SX) according to international standards. When the NMB recovered spontaneously to train-of-four count 2, patients randomly received 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, or 4.0 mg/kg of sugammadex or placebo. Recovery time from sugammadex injection to normalized train-of-four (TOF) ratio 0.9 was the primary outcome variable. The recovery time from the sugammadex injection to final T1 was the secondary end point. Postoperative neuromuscular functions were also assessed. RESULTS: Each patient who received sugammadex recovered to a normalized TOF ratio of 0.9 within 5.0 minutes (95{\%} lower confidence interval for the lowest dose 70.1{\%}; for all doses 90.8{\%}) and 79{\%} of these patients reached a normalized TOF ratio 0.9 within 2.0 minutes (95{\%} lower confidence interval for the lowest dose 26.7{\%}; for all doses 63.7{\%}). T1 recovered several minutes after the TOF ratio. No residual postoperative NMB was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Sugammadex adequately and rapidly reverses pipecuronium-induced moderate NMB during sevoflurane anesthesia. Once the train-of-four count has spontaneously returned to 2 responses following pipecuronium administration, a dose of 2.0 mg/kg of sugammadex is sufficient to reverse the NMB.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare sugammadex and neostigmine regarding the efficacy in reversing rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block, the incidence of post-operative respiratory complications and costs in patients undergoing surgery for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). METHODS: After obtaining ethical approval and patient consent, 74 patients in ASA physical status I or II were randomised into two groups to receive 2-mg kg(-1) sugammadex (Group S) or 0.04-mg kg(-1) neostigmine+0.5-mg atropine (Group N). Groups were compared regarding time to TOF (train-of-four) 0.9, operating room time, post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) stay, post-operative respiratory complications, costs related to neuromuscular block reversal, anaesthesia care and complication treatment. RESULTS: Patient demographics, anaesthesia, surgical data and total rocuronium doses were similar between groups. Time to TOF 0.9 was shorter for group S {$[$}Group N: 8 (5-18) min; Group S: 2 (1.5-6) min (p<0.001){$]$}. Operating room time {$[$}Group S: 72.4$\pm$14.3 min; Group N: 96.6$\pm$22.8 min (p<0.001){$]$} and PACU stay {$[$}Group S: 22.9$\pm$10.1 dk; Group N: 36.3$\pm$12.6 dk (p<0.001){$]$} were also shorter in Group S. After extubation, desaturation was observed in 12 (32.4{\%}) patients in group N and in 4 (8{\%}) patients in group S (p=0.048). In group N, three patients were reintubated; there were eight (21.6{\%}) unplanned intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. There was one unplanned ICU admission in group S. Negative pressure pulmonary oedema was observed in one patient in group N. The results regarding costs were as follows. The reversal cost was higher in the sugammadex group (vial cost 98.14 TL) than that in the neostigmine group (ampoule cost 0.27 TL; total 6147.88 TL vs. 3569.5 TL); however, complication treatment cost and total cost were lower in group S than those in group N (199.5 TL vs. 3944.6 TL) (staff anaesthesia doctor cost was 0.392 TL per min and the cost of nurse anaesthetist was 0.244 TL per min). CONCLUSION: This study confirmed the efficacy of sugammadex over neostigmine for the reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block. Sugammadex decreases the incidence of post-operative respiratory complications and related costs in patients with OSA.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to identify the frequency of residual neuromuscular blockade (RNMB) in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) of a tertiary university hospital in Greece, and its correlation with reversal agents. The influence of other perioperative factors was assessed secondarily. METHODS: Patients >18 years old, undergoing surgery with general anesthesia were prospectively studied during a 6-month period. Immediately after arrival at the PACU, the train-of-four ratio (TOF) was assessed by independent investigators, using accelerometry 3 consecutive times, and the mean value was calculated. When TOF was <0.9, RNMB was diagnosed and further interventions were decided. All perioperative data, including history of patients, anesthetic drugs used and surgical details, were recorded from the patients' files. RESULTS: Five hundred twenty patients were studied; 90.4{\%} received rocuronium, 9.2{\%} cis-atracurium, and 0.4{\%} succinylcholine. The prevalence of RNMB was 10.8{\%}. A significant difference (P=0.0006) was detected between patients who received neostigmine versus sugammadex, with the latter showing higher TOF values postoperatively, although the actual incidence of RNMB did not differ between the two groups. Patients with coexisting diseases received sugammadex more frequently (P<0.001), while women, and patients ASA>III were more likely to exhibit RNMB (P=0.02 and P=0.05 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of RNMB was 10.8{\%}. Patients who received sugammadex presented with higher TOF values at the PACU, although no difference in RNMB was detected compared to neostigmine. Female gender and the presence of comorbidities increased the possibility to exhibit RNMB at the PACU.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Residual postoperative paralysis from nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) is a known problem. This paralysis has been associated with impaired respiratory function, but the clinical significance remains unclear. The aims of this analysis were two-fold: (1) to investigate if intermediate-acting NMBA use during surgery is associated with postoperative pneumonia and (2) to investigate if nonreversal of NMBAs is associated with postoperative pneumonia. METHODS: Surgical cases (n = 13,100) from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database who received general anesthesia were included. The authors compared 1,455 surgical cases who received an intermediate-acting nondepolarizing NMBA to 1,455 propensity score-matched cases who did not and 1,320 surgical cases who received an NMBA and reversal with neostigmine to 1,320 propensity score-matched cases who did not receive reversal. Postoperative pneumonia incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and bootstrapped 95{\%} CIs were calculated. RESULTS: Patients receiving an NMBA had a higher absolute incidence rate of postoperative pneumonia (9.00 vs. 5.22 per 10,000 person-days at risk), and the IRR was statistically significant (1.79; 95{\%} bootstrapped CI, 1.08 to 3.07). Among surgical cases who received an NMBA, cases who were not reversed were 2.26 times as likely to develop pneumonia after surgery compared to cases who received reversal with neostigmine (IRR, 2.26; 95{\%} bootstrapped CI, 1.65 to 3.03). CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative use of intermediate nondepolarizing NMBAs is associated with developing pneumonia after surgery. Among patients who receive these agents, nonreversal is associated with an increased risk of postoperative pneumonia.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to evaluate the clinical and economic impact of introducing a rocuronium-neostigmine-sugammadex strategy into a cisatracurium-neostigmine regimen for neuromuscular block (NMB) management. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness in five operating rooms at University Hospital of Padova. A clinical outcome evaluation after sugammadex administration as first-choice reversal drug in selected patients (rocuronium-sugammadex) and as rescue therapy after neostigmine reversal (rocuronium-neostigmine-sugammadex) compared to control was performed. A cost-analysis of NMB management accompanying the introduction of a rocuronium-neostigmine-sugammadex strategy into a cisatracurium-neostigmine regimen was carried out. To such purpose, two periods were compared: 2011-2012, without sugammadex available; 2013-2014, with sugammadex available. A subsequent analysis was performed to evaluate if sugammadex replacing neostigmine as first choice reversal drug is cost-effective. RESULTS: The introduction of a rocuronium-neostigmine-sugammadex strategy into a cisatracurium-neostigmine regimen reduced the average cost of NMB management by 36{\%}, from €20.8/case to €13.3/case. Patients receiving sugammadex as a first-choice reversal drug (3{\%}) exhibited significantly better train-of-four ratios at extubation (P<0.001) and were discharged to the surgical ward (P<0.001) more rapidly than controls. The cost-saving of sugammadex as first-choice reversal drug has been estimated to be €2.9/case. Patients receiving sugammadex as rescue therapy after neostigmine reversal (3.2{\%}) showed no difference in time to discharge to the surgical ward (P=0.44) compared to controls. No unplanned intensive care unit (ICU) admissions with rocuronium-neostigmine-sugammadex strategy were observed. The potential economic benefit in avoiding postoperative residual curarization (PORC)-related ICU admission in the 2013-2014 period was estimated at an average value of €13,548 (€9,316-€23,845). CONCLUSION: Sugammadex eliminated PORC and associated morbidities. In our center, sugammadex reduced the costs of NMB management and promoted rapid turnover of patients in operating rooms, with total cost-effectiveness that counteracts the disadvantages of its high cost.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neuromuscular block (NMB) monitoring and use of reversal agents accelerate the recovery time and improve the workflow in the operating room. We aimed to compare recovery times after sugammadex or neostigmine administration, and estimate the time spent in operating theater and the possible economic impact of a faster recovery, in morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study that analyzed data from records of morbidly obese patients (body mass index >40 kg/m(2)) undergoing elective laparoscopic bariatric surgery in which sugammadex or neostigmine were used to reverse NMB. Patients were divided in two groups: group 1 (sugammadex group {$[$}SUG{$]$}) received rocuronium and sugammadex for reversal and group 2 (neostigmine group {$[$}NEO{$]$}) received either rocuronium or cisatracurium and neostigmine. Data are presented as mean (standard deviation). RESULTS: Compared with NEO, SUG group showed shorter times to achieve train-of-four ratio of 0.9 (P<0.05) and an Aldrete score of 10 (P<0.05), a higher cost (€146.7 vs €3.6 {$[$}P<0.05{$]$}), plus a remarkable less duration of operating theater occupancy (P<0.05). Sugammadex cost accounted for 2.58{\%} of the total cost per surgery, while neostigmine cost accounted for 0.06{\%}. Total time saved in SUG group was 19.4 hours, which could be used to perform 12 extra laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomies. CONCLUSION: Reversal from NMB was significantly faster with sugammadex than with neostigmine. Although sugammadex was substantially more expensive, duration of operating theater occupancy was reduced with potentially workflow increase or personnel reduced cost.},

	abstract = {During surgery, changes in intraocular pressure (IOP) can be observed resulting from several factors, such as airway manipulations and drugs used. We aimed to investigate the effects of sugammadex and neostigmine on IOP, hemodynamic parameters, and complications after extubation. Our study comprised 60 patients, aged 18-65 years, with a risk status of the American Society of Anesthesiologists I-II who underwent arthroscopic surgery under general anesthesia. The patients were randomly assigned into two groups. At the end of the surgery, the neuromuscular block was reversed using neostigmine (50 μg/kg) plus atropine (15 μg/kg) in Group 1, and sugammadex (4 mg/kg) in Group 2. Neuromuscular blockade was monitored using acceleromyography and a train-of-four mode of stimulation. IOP was measured before induction and at 30 seconds, 2 minutes, and 10 minutes after extubation. A Tono-Pen XL applanation tonometer was used to measure IOP. This showed that elevation in IOP of patients reversed using sugammadex was similar to that recorded in patients reversed using neostigmine-atropine. When heart rate was compared, there was a significant difference between basal values and those obtained at 30 seconds and 10 minutes after extubation in the neostigmine-atropine group. Extubation time (time from withdrawal of anesthetic gas to extubation) was significantly shorter in the sugammadex group (p = 0.003) than in the neostigmine-atropine group. The postextubation IOP values of the sugammadex group were similar to the neostigmine-atropine group. Extubation time (time from withdrawal of anesthetic gas to extubation) was significantly shorter in the sugammadex group (p = 0.003) than in the neostigmine-atropine group.},

@article{Kaufhold2016,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this dose-finding study was to evaluate the dose-response relationship of sugammadex and neostigmine to reverse a commonly observed level of incomplete recovery from rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block, that is, a train-of-four ratio (TOFR) ≥0.2. METHODS: Ninety-nine anaesthetized patients received rocuronium 0.6 mg kg(-1) i.v. for tracheal intubation and, if necessary, incremental doses of 0.1-0.2 mg kg(-1). Neuromuscular monitoring was performed by calibrated electromyography. Once the TOFR recovered to 0.2, patients were randomized to receive sugammadex (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, or 1.25 mg kg(-1) i.v.), neostigmine (10, 25, 40, 55, or 70 µg kg(-1) i.v.), or saline (n=9 per group). Primary and secondary end points were the doses necessary to restore neuromuscular function to a TOFR≥0.9 with an upper limit of 5 and 10 min for 95{\%} of patients, respectively. RESULTS: Neostigmine was not able to fulfil the end points. Based on the best-fitting model, the sugammadex dose estimation for recovery to a TOFR≥0.9 for 95{\%} of patients within 5 and 10 min was 0.49 and 0.26 mg kg(-1), respectively. CONCLUSION: A residual neuromuscular block of a TOFR of 0.2 cannot be reversed reliably with neostigmine within 10 min. In the conditions studied, substantially lower doses of sugammadex than the approved dose of 2.0 mg kg(-1) may be sufficient to reverse residual rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block at a recovery of TOFR≥0.2.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: According to several studies investigating the relationship between muscle activity and electroencephalogram results, reversal of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) may affect depth of anesthesia indices. Therefore, we investigated the effect of pyridostigmine on these indices via spectral entropy. METHODS: Fifty-six patients scheduled for thyroidectomy or parotidectomy were included in this study and randomized into two groups. At the start of skin suturing, the desflurane concentration was adjusted to 4.2 vol{\%} in both groups. Following this, the pyridostigmine group (group P, n = 28) was administered pyridostigmine 0.2 mg/kg mixed with glycopyrrolate 0.04 mg/kg, while the control group (group C, n = 28) received normal saline. Entropy values (response entropy {$[$}RE{$]$} and state entropy {$[$}SE{$]$}), train of four (TOF) ratio, and end-tidal desflurane concentration were recorded from point of drug administration to 15 minutes post-drug administration. RESULTS: Mean RE values at 15 minutes, when the maximum effect of pyridostigmine was anticipated, showed a statistically significant difference between groups (53.8 $\pm$10.5 in group P and 48.0 $\pm$8.8 in group C; P = 0.030). However, mean SE at 15 minutes showed no significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.066). At 15 minutes, there were significant differences in the TOF ratio between the two groups (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: NMB reversal by pyridostigmine significantly increased RE values but not SE values. This finding suggests that spectral entropy may be a useful alternative tool for monitoring anesthetic depth during recovery from anesthesia in the presence of electromyogram activity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The primary outcome of sugammadex reversal for rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block (NMB) is a train-of-four ratio (TOFR) of 0.9, not first twitch (T1) height. We investigated whether the recovery of TOFR or T1 differs based on the reversal of NMB with neostigmine or sugammadex. METHODS: The acceleromyographic responses from 0.6 mg/kg of rocuronium were monitored supramaximally in 80 patients after induction of anesthesia. The TOFR and T1 height were recorded, and saved in a personal computer using TOF-Watch SX Monitor software in all patients. Patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups to receive either neostigmine 50 µg/kg with glycopyrrolate 10 µg/kg (neostigmine group, n = 40) or sugammadex 2.0 mg/kg (sugammadex group, n = 40). The primary objective was to determine the difference of recovery time between TOFR to 0.9 and T1 to 0.9 after sugammadex or neostigmine administration during moderate rocuronium-induced NMB. RESULTS: The recovery pattern of the TOFR 2 min after sugammadex administration was 1.0 or more, but that of T1 was less than 90{\%} (T1 / control value) up to 6 min after drug was injected. The recovery pattern of TOFR and T1 was similar during the 20 min after reversal with neostigmine. CONCLUSIONS: If you have not performed the T1 monitoring, both TOFR and T1 should be considered to confirm suitable recovery during the 6 min after reversal with sugammadex during rocuronium-induced moderate NMB.},

This study evaluates the incidence of PORC in the Postanesthesia Care Unit (PACU), its relation to the type of muscle relaxant and reversal agent used, and its implication in the development of postoperative respiratory complications. METHODS: A prospective observational study of cohorts was made with 558 patients operated under general anesthesia. Data regarding patient history, muscle relaxation (train-of-four {$[$}TOF{$]$}) monitoring, type of relaxants and reversal agents used, and TOF upon admission to the PACU was collected. Four groups were established: cisatracurium, cisatracurium-neostigmine, rocuronium, and rocuronium-sugammadex. An evaluation was made on the incidence of PORC (TOF ratio {$[$}TOFr{$]$} <0.9) in PACU, and its relation to the relaxants and reversal agents used and to the development of postoperative respiratory complications - minor and major (pneumonia, atelectasis). RESULTS: From a total of 558 patients, 27.9{\%} presented with PORC. According to the NMBD used and the administration or not of a reversal agent, the incidence of PORC in the four groups was: cisatracurium 34{\%}, cisatracurium-neostigmine 28.6{\%}, rocuronium 34{\%}, and rocuronium-sugammadex 1.15{\%}. The global incidence of minor critical respiratory events (CREs) was 14.5{\%}: cisatracurium 27.5{\%}, cisatracurium-neostigmine 17.4{\%}, rocuronium 10.5{\%}, and rocuronium-sugammadex 2.3{\%}, with statistically significant differences. The global incidence of major CREs was 7.5{\%}, and was significantly higher in patients with TOFr<0.9 upon admission to the PACU. CONCLUSIONS: PORC in the PACU is associated to a greater incidence of major and minor respiratory complications. The use of rocuronium-sugammadex significantly reduces the incidence of PORC in the PACU.},

We evaluated the effects of sugammadex on POD in elderly patients who underwent hip fracture surgery. METHODS: Medical records of 174 consecutive patients who underwent hip fracture surgery with general anesthesia were reviewed retrospectively to compare the perioperative incidence of POD, pulmonary complications, time to extubation, incidence of hypoxia, and laboratory findings between patients treated with sugammadex and those treated with a conventional cholinesterase inhibitor. RESULTS: The incidence of POD was not significantly different between the two groups (33.3{\%} versus 36.5{\%}, resp.; P = 0.750). Postoperative pulmonary complications and laboratory findings did not showed significant intergroup difference. However, time to extubation (6 $\pm$3 versus 8 $\pm$3 min; P < 0.001) and the frequency of postoperative hypoxia were significantly lower (23{\%} versus 43{\%}; P = 0.010) in the sugammadex group than in the conventional cholinesterase inhibitor group.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In many countries, routine clinical anaesthesia does not always involve neuromuscular monitoring. In these clinical settings, the efficacy and safety of sugammadex use has not yet been confirmed. We investigated the efficacy and safety of sugammadex in the absence of neuromuscular monitoring. METHODS: One hundred and forty patients who underwent laryngeal microsurgery with the use of rocuronium as a neuromuscular blocking agent, without the use of a neuromuscular monitoring device, were retrospectively investigated. The patients were randomly chosen among all the patients who met the inclusion criteria at a tertiary university hospital between July 2013 and February 2015 and were allocated to group S (sugammadex group) or group P (pyridostigmine group) according to the neuromuscular reversal agent administered. Five patients were excluded from analysis and 135 patients completed the study. Primary outcome was extubation time. Secondary outcomes were anaesthesia time, the correlation between anaesthesia time and extubation time, the total amount of rocuronium, and postoperative adverse events in the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU). RESULTS: Extubation time was significantly shorter in group S (6.3 $\pm$3.9 min) than in group P (9.0 $\pm$5.4 min). Anaesthesia time was also significantly shorter in group S (30.7 $\pm$10.3 min) than in group P (35.8 $\pm$12.6 min). In the patients with an anaesthesia time of 30 min or less, there was a positive correlation between anaesthesia time and extubation time in group P (r = 0.453), but there was no significant relationship in group S. The total amount of rocuronium used was higher in group S (0.62 $\pm$0.11 mg kg(-1)) than in group P (0.38 $\pm$0.14 mg kg(-1)). Postoperative adverse events in the PACU were comparable between the groups, except for tachycardia events: the incidence of tachycardia was significantly lower in group S (8.0 {\%}) than in group P (17.3 {\%}). CONCLUSIONS: Sugammadex could shorten anaesthesia and extubation times as well as recovery time in the PACU and reduce postoperative hemodynamic complications in a clinical setting in the absence of neuromuscular monitoring. This may enhance the patients' recovery in the operating room and PACU while improving the postoperative condition of patients.

@article{Preault2016,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been demonstrated that small doses of neostigmine (10-30μg.kg(-1)) effectively antagonize atracurium blocks at a train-of-four (TOF) ratio of 0.4 under propofol anaesthesia. The results might not be valid with halogenated agents, which potentiate neuromuscular blockades. The goal of this study was to determine the dose of neostigmine required to antagonize a block corresponding to a TOF ratio of 0.4, a level at which fade is not visually detected. METHODS: Sixty patients were included and anaesthesia was induced with propofol, remifentanil and cisatracurium, and maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. Patients were randomized to receive neostigmine at 40, 20, 10μg.kg(-1) or placebo with atropine (20, 10, 5 or 0μg.kg(-1), respectively) as soon as the TOF ratio reached 0.4. Elapsed times to 0.9 and 1.0 TOF ratios were measured. RESULTS: The median times elapsed from 0.4 to 0.9 and 1.0 TOF ratios in the placebo group were 19 (10.5-36) min and 26 (20-50) min, respectively, and significantly shorter (I=0.002) with any dose of neostigmine than without. Times for complete recovery after 40 and 20μg.kg(-1) neostigmine were similar {$[$}5.5 (4-11) min and 7.8 (3.5-11) min, respectively{$]$} but significantly shorter than after 10μg.kg(-1) neostigmine {$[$}17min (7-55); I=0.001{$]$}. CONCLUSION: Under sevoflurane anaesthesia, in absence of tactile or visual TOF fade, which corresponds to a TOF ratio≥0.4, 20μg.kg(-1) neostigmine is as effective as 40μg.kg(-1) in antagonizing shallow cisatracurium block.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine if reversing a deep or moderate block with sugammadex, compared with a shallow block reversed with neostigmine, reduces the time to operating room discharge after surgery and the time spent in the postanesthesia care unit. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Monocentric study performed from February 2011 until May 2012. PATIENTS: One hundred consenting women with American Society of Anesthesiologists grade I or II were randomized into 2 groups. INTERVENTION: Laparoscopic hysterectomy was performed under desflurane general anesthesia. For the neostigmine (N) group, 0.45 mg ·kg(-1) rocuronium was followed by spontaneous recovery. A 5-mg rescue bolus was administered only if surgical evaluation was unacceptable. At the end of surgery, 50 μg ·kg(-1) neostigmine with glycopyrrolate was administered. For the sugammadex (S) group, a higher intubating rocuronium dose (0.6 mg ·kg(-1)) was followed by 5-mg boluses each time the train-of-four count exceeded 2. Sugammadex (2-4 mg ·kg(-1)) was administered to reverse the block. All patients were extubated after obtaining a train-of-four ratio of 0.9. MEASUREMENTS: The duration between the end of surgery and operating room discharge and the time spent in the postanesthesia care unit. MAIN RESULTS: The time till operating room discharge was shorter and more predictable in group S (9.15$\pm$4.28 minutes vs 13.87$\pm$11.43 minutes in group N; P=.005). The maximal duration in group S was 22 minutes, compared with 72 minutes in group N. The time spent in the postanesthesia care unit was not significantly different (group S: 47.75$\pm$31.77 minutes and group N: 53.43$\pm$40.57 minutes; P=.543). CONCLUSION: Maintaining a deep neuromuscular block during laparoscopic hysterectomy reversed at the end of the procedure with sugammadex enabled a faster and more predictable time till operating room discharge than did the classical combination of a shallower block reversed with neostigmine.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: The aim of this prospective randomized trial is to compare the quality of reversal of rocuronium with either sugammadex (SUG) versus 2.5 mg or 5 mg neostigmine (NEO). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 110 patients with body mass index >40 underwent elective gastric sleeve surgery were enrolled in this study. Exclusion criteria included patients with co-existing muscular and cardiovascular diseases. Patients were randomly allocated to one of the following groups: group A (SUG), Group B (NEO 2.5 mg), and Group C (NEO 5 mg). General anesthesia was induced in the three groups using propofol 2.0 mg/kg of corrected body weight (CBW) and fentanyl 3 mcg/kg of CBW. Anesthesia was maintained with O(2)/air/desflurane 1 minimum alveolar concentration. Remifentanil infusion started at 0.05-0.2 mcg/kg/min. Tracheal intubation was facilitated with rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg of CBW guided with PNS. When the train of four (TOF) reached zero, intubation was performed using a GlideScope. At the end of surgery, TOF ratio and posttetanic counts were recorded. SUG 2 mg/kg of CBW (Group A), NEO 2.5 mg (Group B), and NEO 5 mg (Group C) were administered according to the random envelope. The time to achieve 90{\%} of TOF was recorded in seconds using a timer. ANOVA for repeated measurements was used for statistical analyses. P <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: There was a positive correlation (P < 0.05) between the duration of surgery and the time to reach 90{\%} of TOF in all the three groups. The time to reach 90{\%} TOF was significantly shorter with Group A versus Groups B and C (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Although SUG proved to be faster than NEO 5 mg in attaining TOF >90{\%}, the recovery pattern of both was similar.},

@article{Ammar2017,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sugammadex is designed to be a reversal agent for steroidal muscle relaxants. The current trial was aimed to compare between sugammadex and neostigmine concerning the recovery time from neuromuscular blockade. We hypothesised that sugammadex might have shorter recovery time than neostigmine. METHODS: Sixty paediatric patients aged 2-10 years scheduled for lower abdominal surgeries were randomly assigned into two equal groups to receive 4 mg/kg sugammadex (Group S) or 0.35 mg/kg neostigmine and 0.02 mg/kg atropine (Group N) as a reversal agent for rocuronium at the end of surgery. Primary outcome was the recovery time {$[$}time from starting of sugammadex or neostigmine till reaching train of four (TOF) ratio> 0.9{$]$} whereas secondary outcomes included number of patients who needed another dose of sugammadex or neostigmine to reach TOF ratio> 0.9, extubation time (time from stoppage of anaesthetic inhalation until the patient fulfilled criteria for safe extubation, post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) discharge time and post-operative adverse effects. RESULTS: The mean recovery and extubation times were significantly shorter (P = 0.002 and 0.005) in Group S compared with Group N (2.5 and 2.0 min vs. 12.6 min and 4.3 min respectively). In the Group N, eight patients needed another reversal dose compared with one patient in Group S (P = 0.035). PACU discharge time showed no significant difference between both groups. Incidence of nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, and dry mouth were significantly higher in Group N. CONCLUSION: Sugammadex administration in children resulted in faster recovery and extubation times and lower incidence of adverse events compared with neostigmine.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block that spontaneously recovered to a train-of-four count of four can be reversed with sugammadex 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg. We investigated whether these doses of sugammadex can also reverse vecuronium at a similar level of block. METHODS: Sixty-five patients were randomly assigned, and 64 were analyzed in this controlled, superiority study. Participants received general anesthesia with propofol, sevoflurane, fentanyl, and vecuronium. Measurement of neuromuscular function was performed with acceleromyography (TOF-Watch-SX, Organon Teknika B.V., The Netherlands ). Once the block recovered spontaneously to four twitches in response to train-of-four stimulation, patients were randomly assigned to receive sugammadex 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg/kg; neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg; or placebo. Time from study drug injection to normalized train-of-four ratio 0.9 and the incidence of incomplete reversal within 30 min were the primary outcome variables. Secondary outcome was the incidence of reparalysis (normalized train-of-four ratio less than 0.9). RESULTS: Sugammadex, in doses of 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg, reversed a threshold train-of-four count of four to normalized train-of-four ratio of 0.9 or higher in all patients in 4.4 $\pm$2.3 min (mean $\pm$SD) and 2.6 $\pm$1.6 min, respectively. Sugammadex 0.5 mg/kg reversed the block in 6.8 $\pm$4.1 min in 70{\%} of patients (P < 0.0001 vs. 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg), whereas neostigmine produced reversal in 11.3 $\pm$9.7 min in 77{\%} of patients (P > 0.05 vs. sugammadex 0.5 mg/kg). The overall frequency of reparalysis was 18.7{\%}, but this incidence varied from group to group. CONCLUSIONS: Sugammadex 1.0 mg/kg, unlike 0.5 mg/kg, properly reversed a threshold train-of-four count of four vecuronium-induced block but did not prevent reparalysis.},

This study aims to estimate the incidence of post-operative complications associated with use of NMBAs and assessing its association with healthcare resource utilization. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. SETTING: Post-anesthesia care unit in tertiary care center. PATIENTS: Adults having non-cardiac surgery and receiving NMBAs between April-2005 and December-2013 MEASUREMENTS: We assessed: 1) incidences of major and minor PACU complications, 2) incidence of any postoperative complication in patients receiving a NMBA reversal (neostigmine) vs. without. 3) We secondarily assessed the relationship between PACU complications and use of healthcare resources. MAIN RESULTS: The incidence of any major complications was 2.1{\%} and that of any minor complication was 35.2{\%}. ICU admission rate was 1.3{\%} in patients without any complications, versus 5.2{\%} in patients with any minor and 30.6{\%} in patients with any major complication. ICU length of stay was prolonged in patients with any major (52.1$\pm$203h), compared to patients with any minor (6.2$\pm$64h) and with no complications (1.7$\pm$28h). Patients who received a NMBA and neostigmine, compared to without neostigmine, had a lower incidence of any major complication (1.7{\%} vs. 6.05{\%}), rate of re-intubation (0.8{\%} vs. 4.6{\%}) and unplanned ICU admission (0.8{\%} vs. 3.2{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: This study documents that incidence of major PACU complications after non-cardiac surgery was 2.1{\%}, with the most frequent complications being re-intubation and ICU admission. Patients receiving NMBA reversal were at a lower risk of re-intubation and unplanned ICU admission, justifying routine use of reversals. Complete NMBA reversals are crucial in reducing preventable patient harm and healthcare utilization.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs (NNMBDs) are commonly used as an adjunct to general anesthesia. Residual blockade is common, but its potential adverse effects are incompletely known. This study was designed to assess the association between NNMBD use with or without neostigmine reversal and postoperative morbidity and mortality. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study of 11,355 adult patients undergoing general anesthesia for noncardiac surgery at 5 Veterans Health Administration (VA) hospitals. Of those, 8984 received NNMBDs, and 7047 received reversal with neostigmine. The primary outcome was a composite of respiratory complications (failure to wean from the ventilator, reintubation, or pneumonia), which was "yes" if a patient had any of the 3 component events and "no" if they had none. Secondary outcomes were nonrespiratory complications, 30-day and long-term all-cause mortality. We adjusted for differences in patient risk using propensity matched (PM) followed by assessment of the association of interest by logistic regression between the matched pairs as our primary analysis and multivariable logistic regression (MLR) as a sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Our primary aim was to assess the adverse outcomes in the patients who had received NNMBDs with and without neostigmine. Administration of an NNMBD without neostigmine reversal compared with NNMBD with neostigmine reversal was associated with increased odds of respiratory complications (PM odds ratio {$[$}OR{$]$}, 1.75 {$[$}95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$}, 1.23-2.50{$]$}; MLR OR, 1.71 {$[$}CI, 1.24-2.37{$]$}) and a marginal increase in 30-day mortality (PM OR, 1.83 {$[$}CI, 0.99-3.37{$]$}; MLR OR, 1.78 {$[$}CI, 1.02-3.13{$]$}). However, there were no statistically significant associations with nonrespiratory complications or long-term mortality. Patients who were administered an NNMBD followed by neostigmine had no differences in outcomes compared with patients who had general anesthesia without an NNMBD. CONCLUSIONS: The use of NNMBDs without neostigmine reversal was associated with increased odds of our composite respiratory outcome compared with patients reversed with neostigmine. Based on these data, we conclude that reversal of NNMBDs should become a standard practice if extubation is planned.},

Forty-four patients undergoing elective laryngeal micro-surgery were randomly allocated into two groups: rocuronium 0.45 mg.kg(-1) with neostigmine (50 μg.kg(-1) with glycopyrrolate 10 μg.kg(-1) ) reversal (moderate block group) vs. rocuronium 0.90 mg.kg(-1) with sugammadex (4 mg.kg(-1) ) reversal (deep block group). The primary outcome was the intubating conditions during laryngoscopy secondary outcomes included recovery of neuromuscular block; conditions for tracheal intubation; satisfaction score as determined by the surgeon; onset of neuromuscular block; and postoperative sore throat. The onset of neuromuscular block was more rapid, and intubation conditions and ease of intra-operative laryngoscopy were more favourable, and the satisfaction score was lower in the moderate block group compared with the deep block group. No difference was found in the incidence of postoperative sore throat. In laryngeal micro-surgery, the use of rocuronium 0.9 mg.kg(-1) with sugammadex for reversal was associated with better surgical conditions and a shorter recovery time than rocuronium 0.45 mg.kg(-1) with neostigmine.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sugammadex is a new agent that reverses neuromuscular blockade by aminosteroid neuromuscular blocker. This retrospective study compared the effects of sugammadex on post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) with those of a pyridostigmine-glycopyrrolate mixture. METHODS: We reviewed the electronic medical records of 7179 patients who had received fentanyl-based, intravenous, patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA) at Chung-Ang University Hospital between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2015. We categorized the patients into two groups on the basis of the type of reversal agent to neuromuscular blockade that was used: a traditional reversal agent (pyridostigmine-glycopyrrolate mixture; Group R; n = 7059) and sugammadex (Group S; n = 120). The propensity score matching method was then used to select 408 subjects in Group R and 115 subjects in Group S; on the basis of their covariates, these subjects were then matched with a counterpart in the other group. RESULTS: After propensity score matching, the two groups were well balanced with respect to all baseline covariates. In Group S, the numeric rating scale of nausea on day 0, as well as the number of patients who vomited on day 0, was lower than that in group R. Furthermore, Group S used fewer rescue antiemetics on day 0 and had a higher complete response on day 0. CONCLUSION: Sugammadex might be more beneficial for PONV compared to pyridostigmine-glycopyrrolate mixture for patients who have received opioid-based IV-PCA.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Electronic neuromuscular monitoring is not widely used to determine either the reversal requirements for neuromuscular block before extubation of the trachea, or to determine if there is any subsequent postoperative residual neuromuscular block (PORNB). OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incidence of PORNB using acceleromyography after spontaneous recovery of rocuronium-induced block and to compare this with the administration of sugammadex, neostigmine or a placebo. DESIGN: Partially randomised, partially randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, four-group parallel-arm study. SETTING: Single-centre study performed between October 2013 and December 2015 in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Of the 134 eligible patients, 128 gave their consent and 125 of these completed the study. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received general anaesthesia with propofol, sevoflurane, fentanyl and rocuronium. Neuromuscular transmission was measured by acceleromyography (TOF-Watch-SX; Organon Teknika B.V., Boxtel, the Netherlands) but the anaesthetist was blind to the results. If the anaesthetist deemed pharmacological reversal to be necessary before extubation of the trachea then patients were assigned randomly to receive either sugammadex (2.0 mg kg), neostigmine (0.05 mg kg) or a placebo. In the postanaesthesia care unit, an independent anaesthetist, unaware of the treatment given, assessed the neuromuscular function using acceleromyography. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The incidence of a normalised train-of-four ratio less than 0.9 on arrival in the recovery room. RESULTS: In total, 125 patients were recruited. Neuromuscular block was allowed to recover spontaneously in 50 patients, whereas the remainder received either sugammadex (27), neostigmine (26) or placebo (22). The number of cases with PORNB were one (3.7{\%}), four (15{\%}), 13 (26{\%}) and 10 (45{\%}) after sugammadex, neostigmine, spontaneous recovery and placebo, respectively. Sugammadex and neostigmine were more effective than placebo {$[$}odds ratio (OR): 0.05, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.005 to 0.403, P = 0.005; OR: 0.22, 95{\%} CI: 0.056 to 0.85, P = 0.028, respectively{$]$}. Sugammadex performed better than spontaneous recovery (OR: 0.11, 95{\%} CI: 0.014 to 0.89, P = 0.039) unlike neostigmine (OR: 0.52, 95{\%} CI: 0.15 to 1.79, P = 0.297). Yet, antagonism (pooled data) was more effective than spontaneous recovery (OR: 0.3, 95{\%} CI: 0.1 to 0.9, P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Although pharmacological reversal based on clinical signs was superior to spontaneous recovery it did not prevent PORNB, irrespective of the reversal agent.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cough on emergence has been reported as a common adverse reaction with sugammadex reversal. We investigated if staggering the dose of sugammadex will reduce emergence cough in a single-center, randomized, double-blinded study. METHODS: A hundred and twenty ASA 1-3 adults were randomly reversed with 1 mg/kg sugammadex prior to extubation followed by another 1 mg/kg immediately after extubation (staggered group), single dose of 2 mg/kg sugammadex (single bolus group) or neostigmine 0.02 mg/kg with glycopyrrolate (neostigmine group). RESULTS: We found 70{\%} of patients (n = 28) reversed with single boluses of sugammadex had Grade 3 emergence cough compared to 12.5{\%} (n = 5) in the staggered sugammadex group and 17.5{\%} (n = 7) in the neostigmine group (p < 0.001). Besides cough, emergence agitation also appeared highest in the single bolus sugammadex group (n = 14, 35{\%}, p = 0.005). On the other hand, staggering sugammadex lowered risks of developing severe cough (RR 0.2, p < 0.001) and agitation (RR 0.43, p = 0.010) on emergence in addition to cough (RR 0.25, p = 0.039) and early sore throat (RR 0.70, p = 0.036) in the post-anesthetic care unit. The risks for severe emergence cough (RR 0.86, p = 0.762), severe cough in the post-anesthetic care unit (RR 1.0, p = 1.000) and sore throat (RR 1.17, p = 0.502) were also not different between the staggered sugammadex group and control given neostigmine. In terms of timing, there was no delay in time taken from discontinuing anesthetic agents to reversal and extubation if sugammadex was staggered (emergence time 6.0 $\pm$3.2 s, p = 0.625 and reversal time 6.5 $\pm$3.5, p = 0.809). CONCLUSIONS: Staggering the dose of sugammadex for reversal will effectively decrease common emergence and early postoperative complications. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ANZCTR Number ACTRN12616000116426 .

RESULTS: Nausea and vomiting were observed in 60{\%} of the patients given sugammadex and 77.5{\%} given neostigmine during the initial 24 hours postoperatively. The incidence of nausea and the need for rescue antiemetic were lower in group S than group N during all time intervals but there were no significant differences between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Sugammadex seems to be effective in decreasing the incidence of PONV, severity of nausea, number of patients who suffered from nausea and vomiting, and need for rescue antiemetic, although there were no significant differences.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study is to compare the effects of sugammadex and neostigmine, used for neuromuscular blockage antagonism, on postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). METHODS: Our study was completed with 98 ASA I-II risk patients undergoing endotracheal intubation under general anesthesia. At the end of the surgery patients were randomly divided into two groups given 2mgkg(-1) sugammadex (Group S) or 50μgkg(-1) neostigmine plus 0.2mgkg(-1) atropine (Group N). Monitoring and recording times were set as 1 hour postoperative and from 1-6, 6-12, and 12-24hours. The anti-emetic amounts administered were recorded. RESULTS: In the first hour postoperative 13 patients in Group N (27{\%}) and 4 in Group S (8{\%}) were observed to have nausea and/or vomiting and the difference was statistically significant (p=0.0016). During the 24 hours of monitoring there was no significant difference in the incidence and severity of PONV (p>0.05), however the number of patients given ondansetron for PONV treatment in Group N was statistically significantly higher than the number in Group S (16 in Group N, 6 in Group S, p<0.011). CONCLUSIONS: At the end of our study comparing neostigmine with sugammadex for neuromuscular blockage antagonism, we found use of sugammadex had lower incidence of PONV in the postoperative 1st hour and less anti-emetic use in 24 hours of monitoring.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This randomized controlled study compared the recovery times of sugammadex and neostigmine as antagonists of moderate rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block in patients with liver cirrhosis and controls undergoing liver resection. METHODS: The study enrolled 27 adult patients with Child class "A" liver cirrhosis and 28 patients with normal liver functions. Normal patients and patients with liver cirrhosis were randomized according to the type of antagonist (sugammadex 2 mg/kg or neostigmine 50 µg/kg). The primary outcome was the time from antagonist administration to a train-of-four (TOF) ratio of 0.9 using mechanosensor neuromuscular transmission module. The durations of the intubating and top-up doses of rocuronium, the length of stay in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), and the incidence of postoperative re-curarization were recorded. RESULTS: The durations of the intubating and top-up doses of rocuronium were prolonged in patients with liver cirrhosis than controls. The times to a TOF ratio of 0.9 were 3.1 (1.0) and 2.6 (1.0) min after sugammadex administration in patients with liver cirrhosis and controls, respectively, P=1.00. The corresponding times after neostigmine administration were longer than sugammadex 14.5 (3.6) and 15.7 (3.6) min, respectively, P<0.001. The duration of PACU stay was shorter with the use of sugammadex compared to neostigmine. We did not encounter postoperative re-curarization after sugammadex or neostigmine. CONCLUSIONS: Sugammadex rapidly antagonize moderate residual rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block in patients with Child class "A" liver cirrhosis undergoing liver resection. Sugammadex antagonism is associated with 80{\%} reduction in the time to adequate neuromuscular recovery compared to neostigmine.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis after administration of sugammadex. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: Sugammadex clinical development program and post-marketing experience. PATIENTS: Surgical patients and healthy volunteers who received sugammadex or placebo/comparator with anesthesia and/or neuromuscular blockade (NMB). INTERVENTIONS: Sugammadex administered as 2.0 mg/kg at reappearance of the second twitch, 4.0 mg/kg at 1-2 post-tetanic count, or 16.0 mg/kg at 3 min after rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg. MEASUREMENTS: Three analytical methods were used: 1) automated MedDRA queries; 2) searches of adverse events (AEs) consistent with treatment-related hypersensitivity reactions as diagnosed by the investigator; and 3) a retrospective adjudication of AEs suggestive of hypersensitivity by a blinded, independent adjudication committee (AC). In addition, a search of all post-marketing reports of events of hypersensitivity was performed, and events were retrospectively adjudicated by an independent AC. Anaphylaxis was determined according to Sampson Criterion 1. MAIN RESULTS: The pooled dataset included 3519 unique subjects who received sugammadex and 544 who received placebo. The automated MedDRA query method showed no apparent increase in hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis with sugammadex as compared to placebo or neostigmine. Similarly, there was a low overall incidence of AEs of treatment-related hypersensitivity (<1{\%}), with no differences between sugammadex and placebo or neostigmine. Finally, the retrospective adjudication of AEs suggestive of hypersensitivity showed a low incidence of hypersensitivity (0.56{\%} and 0.21{\%} for sugammadex 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg, respectively), with an incidence similar to subjects who received placebo (0.55{\%}). There were no confirmed cases of anaphylaxis in the pooled studies. During post-marketing use, spontaneous reports of anaphylaxis occurred with approximately 0.01{\%} of sugammadex doses. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects who received sugammadex with general anesthesia and/or NMB had a low overall incidence of hypersensitivity, with no apparent increase in hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis with sugammadex as compared to placebo or neostigmine.},

	abstract = {Donor safety is the major concern in living donor liver transplantation, although hepatic resection may be associated with postoperative coagulopathy. Recently, the use of sugammadex has been gradually increased, but sugammadex is known to prolong prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). We compared the postoperative coagulation profiles and outcomes of sugammadex versus pyridostigmine group in donors receiving living donor hepatectomy.Consecutive donor hepatectomy performed between September 2013 and August 2016 was retrospectively analyzed. For reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade, donors received sugammadex 4 mg/kg or pyridostigmine 0.25 mg/kg. The primary end-points were laboratory findings (PT, aPTT, hemoglobin, platelet count) and clinically evaluated postoperative bleeding (relaparotomy for bleeding, cumulative volume collected in drains). Secondary outcomes were anesthesia time, postoperative hospital day.Of 992 donors, 383 treated with sugammadex and 609 treated with pyridostigmine for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade. There were no significant differences between both groups for drop in hemoglobin and platelet, prolongation in PT, aPTT, and the amount of 24-h drain volume. Bleeding events within 24 h were reported in 2 (0.3{\%}) for pyridostigmine group and 0 (0{\%}) for sugammadex group (P = .262). Anesthesia time was significantly longer in pyridostigmine group than that in sugammadex group (438.8 $\pm$71.4 vs. 421.3 $\pm$62.3, P < .001). Postoperative hospital stay was significantly longer in pyridostigmine group than that in sugammadex group (P = .002).Sugammadex 4 mg/kg was not associated with increased bleeding tendency, but associated with reduced anesthesia time and hospital stay. Therefore, sugammadex may be safely used and will decrease morbidity in donor undergoing living-donor hepatectomy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: When a muscle relaxant is administered to facilitate intubation, the benefits of anticholinesterase reversal must be balanced with potential risks. The aim of this double-blinded, randomized noninferiority trial was to evaluate the effect of neostigmine administration on neuromuscular function when given to patients after spontaneous recovery to a train-of-four ratio of 0.9 or greater. METHODS: A total of 120 patients presenting for surgery requiring intubation were given a small dose of rocuronium. At the conclusion of surgery, 90 patients achieving a train-of-four ratio of 0.9 or greater were randomized to receive either neostigmine 40 μg/kg or saline (control). Train-of-four ratios were measured from the time of reversal until postanesthesia care unit admission. Patients were monitored for postextubation adverse respiratory events and assessed for muscle strength. RESULTS: Ninety patients achieved a train-of-four ratio of 0.9 or greater at the time of reversal. Mean train-of-four ratios in the control and neostigmine groups before reversal (1.02 vs. 1.03), 5 min postreversal (1.05 vs. 1.07), and at postanesthesia care unit admission (1.06 vs. 1.08) did not differ. The mean difference and corresponding 95{\%} CI of the latter were -0.018 and -0.046 to 0.010. The incidences of postoperative hypoxemic events and episodes of airway obstruction were similar for the groups. The number of patients with postoperative signs and symptoms of muscle weakness did not differ between groups (except for double vision: 13 in the control group and 2 in the neostigmine group; P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Administration of neostigmine at neuromuscular recovery was not associated with clinical evidence of anticholinesterase-induced muscle weakness.

	abstract = {Sugammadex more rapidly and reliably reverses rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block compared with neostigmine, but it is not known if subsequent patient outcomes, including nausea, vomiting and other aspects of recovery are modified. In this study, we compared the recovery characteristics of sugammadex and neostigmine/glycopyrrolate following reversal of neuromuscular block. This was a single-centre, randomised, blinded, parallel-group clinical trial in women undergoing elective day-surgical laparoscopic gynaecological surgery, with a standardised general anaesthesia regimen that included rocuronium. Neuromuscular block was reversed with either sugammadex 2 mg.kg(-1) or neostigmine 40 μg.kg(-1) and glycopyrrolate 400 μg. The primary outcome was the incidence of nausea and vomiting during the first six postoperative hours. Secondary outcomes included other measures of postoperative recovery such as patient symptoms and recovery scores. Three-hundred and four women were analysed by intention-to-treat (sugammadex n = 151, neostigmine n = 153), which included four major protocol violations. There was no significant difference between sugammadex and neostigmine groups in the incidence of early nausea and vomiting (49.0{\%} vs. 51.0{\%}, respectively; OR 0.92, 95{\%}CI 0.59-1.45; p = 0.731). Double vision (11.5{\%} vs. 20.0{\%}; p = 0.044) and dry mouth (71.6{\%} vs. 85.5{\%}; p = 0.003) were less common after sugammadex. Sedation scores at 2 h were also lower after sugammadex (median (IQR {$[$}range{$]$}) 0 (0-3 {$[$}0-10{$]$}) vs. 2 (0-4.{$[$}0-10{$]$}); p = 0.021). Twenty-four-hour recovery scores were not significantly different between groups.

The aim of the study was to compare the effect of reversal of neuromuscular block with sugammadex or neostigmine on lung function after major abdominal surgery. METHODS: One hundred and thirty adults scheduled for major abdominal surgery under combined general and epidural anesthesia were randomly allocated to receive 40 µg of neostigmine or 4 mg·kg(-1) of sugammadex to reverse neuromuscular block. Two blinded researchers performed spirometry and lung ultrasound before the surgery, as well as 1 hr and 24 hr postoperatively. Differences in mean changes from baseline were analyzed with repeated measures analysis of variance. Forced vital capacity (FVC) loss one hour after surgery was the main outcome. Secondary outcomes were differences in rate and size of atelectasis one hour and 24 hr after surgery. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-six patients were included in the main analysis. In the neostigmine group (n = 64), mean (95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}95{\%} CI{$]$}) reduction in FVC after one hour was 0.5 (0.4 to 0.6) L. In the sugammadex group (n = 62), the mean (95{\%} CI) reduction in FVC during the first hour was 0.5 (95{\%} CI, 0.3 to 0.6) L. Thirty-nine percent of patients in the neostigmine group and 29{\%} in the sugammadex group had visible atelectasis. Median {$[$}interquartile range (IQR){$]$} atelectasis area was 9.7 {$[$}4.7-13.1{$]$} cm(2) and 6.8 {$[$}3.6-12.5{$]$} cm(2), respectively. CONCLUSION: We found no differences in pulmonary function in patients reversed with sugammadex or neostigmine in a high-risk population.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Sugammadex has the steroid-encapsulating effect that reverses neuromuscular block induced by aminosteroid neuromuscular-blocking agents. Sugammadex can interact with other drugs that have the same steroidal structure with rocuronium, such as corticosteroids. Corticosteroids play a crucial role in the immunosuppression of kidney transplantation. The purpose of this study was to determine if there are any differences in grafted kidney function in recipients of kidney transplantation when sugammadex or neostigmine is given to the recipient. METHODS: The study included 42 recipients of kidney transplant, with complete, readable medical charts and anesthetic records. Fourteen recipients' neuromuscular block was reversed with sugammadex (group S) and 28 recipients' neuromuscular block was reversed with neostigmine (group N). We tested noninferiority for serum creatinine during the preoperative period and 5 days after transplantation. Short-term (28 days) outcomes of kidney transplantations were assessed by the incidence of acute rejection episodes, graft failure, length of stay at hospital, and mortality. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in demographic characteristics, serum creatinine values, short-term outcomes, and graft survival rates at 28 days' postoperatively between group S and group N (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed no difference in risk of serious adverse effects on short-term graft functions in patients who underwent kidney transplantation. However, considering the sugammadex-corticosteroids interaction, the immunosuppression and long-term effects on grafted kidney functions, current safety experience is insufficient to support the recommendation of routine sugammadex use in this population. These results need to be confirmed by sufficiently powered, controlled, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic studies on larger patient populations.},

In this randomized trial, patients that were American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status (ASA) ≤III candidates for RARC for bladder cancer were randomized into two groups: In the sugammadex (S) group, patients received 2 mg/kg of sugammadex as reversal of neuromuscolar blockade; in the neostigmine (N) group, antagonization was obtained with neostigmine 0.04 mg/kg + atropine 0.02 mg/kg. PONV was evaluated at 30 min, 6 and 24 h after anesthesia. Postoperative cognitive functions and time to resumption of intestinal transit were also investigated. A total of 109 patients were analyzed (54 in the S group and 55 in the N group). The incidence of early PONV was lower in the S group but not statistically significant (S group 25.9{\%} vs. N group 29{\%}; p = 0.711). The Mini-Mental State test mean value was higher in the S group vs. the N group (1 h after surgery: 29.3 (29; 30) vs. 27.6 (27; 30), p = 0.007; 4 h after surgery: 29.5 (30; 30) vs. 28.4 (28; 30), p = 0.05). We did not observe a significant decrease of the PONV after sugammadex administration versus neostigmine use. The Mini-Mental State test mean value was greater in the S group.},

@article{Gaver2019,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sugammadex, with its novel mechanism of action of encapsulation and noncompetitive binding of aminosteroid neuromuscular-blocking agents (rocuronium and vecuronium), may offer distinct advantage to pediatric patients where residual neuromuscular blockade may be poorly tolerated. Data describing its use in the pediatric population are limited, and no large-scale studies are available evaluating the occurrence of adverse event across the full spectrum of ages. We sought to measure the occurrence of adverse events, assess the severity and clinical significance of the events, and quantify a surrogate measure of efficacy of sugammadex compared to neostigmine in a large population and in the full age range of children. METHODS: Beginning in September 2016 through initiation of data collection, we identified from our data warehouse that all patients were treated with sugammadex for reversal of neuromuscular blockade, from birth through adolescence, and retrospectively matched, by case type and age group, to historical neostigmine-treated controls. From subsequent chart review, we quantified occurrence of adverse events and administration of medications to treat adverse events. All cases in the originally identified cohort treated with epinephrine after administration of sugammadex underwent chart review to elicit the cause, in the event that an infrequently occurring event was not captured after the case-matching process. "End-Interval Time," the time from administration of reversal agent to time out of the procedure room, was measured as an indirect assessment of efficacy. RESULTS: Fewer cases of bradycardia were observed in the sugammadex group compared to the neostigmine group in the overall cohort (P < .001) and in the subgroups of older children (P < .001) and adolescents (P < .001). End-interval time, the time measured from administration of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) reversal agent to time out of the operating room, was significantly shorter in sugammadex-treated groups in the overall cohort (mean difference, 2.8; 95{\%} CI, 1.85-3.77; P < .001) and all age groups except for first year (31 days through 12 months). This observation was most pronounced in the neonatal subgroup (mean difference, 11.94 minutes; 95{\%} CI, 4.79-19.1; P < .001). No other adverse events measured were found to be different between treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides data supporting the safe and effective use of sugammadex for reversal of neuromuscular blockade throughout the entire range of ages in the pediatric population. Within age groups, sugammadex demonstrates faster completion of operation compared with neostigmine, with the greatest difference observed in the neonatal population.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The use of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) may affect intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) during anesthesia used during thyroid and parathyroid surgery. METHODS: The use of sugammadex was evaluated in a prospective clinical study during thyroid surgery. Between July 2018 and January 2019, 129 patients were prospectively randomized to either the sugammadex group (group B) or the control group (group A). Group A patients underwent standardized IONM during thyroidectomy, while group B patients used an NMBA-reversal protocol comprised of rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg) in anesthesia induction and sugammadex (2 mg/kg) after first vagal stimulation (V0). A peripheral nerve stimulator was used to monitor the neuromuscular transmission. RESULTS: In our clinical study, it took 26.07 $\pm$3.26 and 50.0 $\pm$8.46 minutes to reach 100{\%} recovery of laryngeal electromyography at injection of the sugammadex group (2 mg/kg) and the control group, respectively (P < 0.001). The train-of-four ratio recovered from 0 to >0.9 within 4 minutes after administering 2 mg/kg of sugammadex at the beginning of resection. Surgery time was significantly shorter in group B than in group A (P < 0.001). Transient recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) paralysis was detected in 4 patients from group A and in 3 patients from group B (P = 0.681). There was no permanent RLN paralysis in the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Our clinical study showed that sugammadex effectively and rapidly improved the inhibition of neuromuscular function induced by rocuronium. The implementation of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular block recovery protocol may lead to tracheal intubation as well as favorable conditions for IONM in thyroid surgery.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of reversal of neuromuscular blockade with sugammadex or neostigmine on postoperative quality of recovery following a single bolus dose of rocuronium after pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) under general anesthesia. DESIGN: Prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. SETTING: This study was conducted in a University Teaching Hospital from February to July 2017. PATIENTS: A total of 84 patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status of I or II who were scheduled to undergo PPV under general anesthesia. INTERVENTIONS: The patients were randomly assigned to the neostigmine (Group N, n = 44) or sugammadex (Group S, n = 40) groups; 3 ml of study drug was prepared for the patients. For patients in Group N, a solution of neostigmine methylsulfate (1 mg) and glycopyrrolate (0.2 mg) was prepared, while a solution of sugammadex sodium (2 mg/kg) and normal saline was prepared for patients in Group S. MEASUREMENTS: The primary endpoint was the effect of sugammadex, compared with neostigmine, on the recovery rate in the physiological domain in patients who underwent PPV with general anesthesia. The quality of recovery was assessed using the Postoperative Quality Recovery Scale at 15 min and 40 min after surgery, and on postoperative day 1. MAIN RESULTS: The recovery rate in the physiological domain was higher in Group S at 15 min after surgery (P = 0.020). Though there were no significant differences in the overall cognitive recovery domain, patients in Group S could recall more numbers in reverse order. However, there were no significant differences between the groups in the other domains of the scale. CONCLUSIONS: The use of sugammadex may increase the quality of physiological recovery at early postoperative periods, compared with that of neostigmine, following a single bolus dose of rocuronium in patients undergoing PPV with general anesthesia.

METHODS: A total of 70 patients (age range: 5-13 years) who underwent an adenotonsillectomy  in the Otolaryngology Clinic, Sakarya University, Sakarya, Turkey between May 2015 and September 2017 were included in the study. The patients were randomized into a sugammadex group (Group S) and a neostigmine + atropine (Group N); each group contained 35 patients. Time to extubation, postoperative agitation levels, and early postoperative complications were evaluated and recorded. Data from both groups were statistically evaluated and compared. RESULTS: The time to extubation was significantly shorter in Group S than Group N (p less than 0.05). Agitation scores during recovery were significantly lower in Group S than Group N (p less than 0.05). More complications were observed in Group N than in Group S; the number of patients seen coughing and experiencing nausea/vomiting in Group S was statistically significantly lower (p less than 0.05).

	abstract = {Use of sugammadex for neuromuscular block reversal is associated with fewer postoperative complications than neostigmine; however, the effects on postoperative pain outcomes are largely unknown. In this retrospective study, we investigated the relationship between neuromuscular reversal agents and postoperative pain-related outcomes following laparoscopic gastric cancer surgery.We reviewed the electronic health records of patients who underwent laparoscopic gastric cancer surgery between January 2010 and June 2017. Patients were divided into a sugammadex group and a neostigmine group, according to the neuromuscular block reversal agent used. We compared the pain outcomes in the first 3 days postoperatively (POD 0-3), length of hospital stay, and postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo grade ≥II).During the study period, 3056 patients received sugammadex (n = 901) or neostigmine (n = 2155) for neuromuscular reversal. After propensity score matching, 1478 patients (739 in each group) were included in regression analysis. In linear regression analysis, intravenous morphine equivalent consumption (mg) during POD 0 to 3 was higher in the sugammadex group than in the neostigmine group {$[$}coefficient 103.41, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 77.45-129.37; P <.001{$]$}. However, hospital stay was shorter (coefficient: -0.60, 95{\%} CI -1.12 to -0.08; P = .025) and postoperative complication rate was lower (odds ratio: 0.20, 95{\%} CI 0.07-0.58; P = .003) in the sugammadex group.In this retrospective study, patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric cancer surgery who received sugammadex for neuromuscular block reversal exhibited greater postoperative analgesic requirements than those who received neostigmine but had a shorter hospital stay and a lower postoperative complication rate. A randomized and blinded study should be conducted in the future to confirm the findings of the present study.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sugammadex is associated with fewer postoperative complications, but its impact on 30-day unplanned readmission is unclear. METHODS: This was a single-centre retrospective observational study of patients after major abdominal surgery between 2010 and 2017, where rocuronium was the only neuromuscular blocker used. The primary endpoint was the difference in incidence of 30-day unplanned readmission between reversal with sugammadex or neostigmine. The secondary endpoints were the length of hospital stay after surgery and related hospital charges (total charges excluding those related to surgery and anaesthesia). Analysis included propensity score matching and generalised mixed-effects modelling. RESULTS: Mixed-effects logistic regression analysis of 1479 patients (sugammadex: 355; neostigmine: 1124) showed that the incidence of 30-day unplanned readmission was 34{\%} lower (odds ratio {$[$}OR{$]$}: 0.66, 95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$}: 0.46-0.96, P=0.031), the length of hospital stay was 20{\%} shorter (exponential regression coefficient: 0.80, 95{\%} CI: 0.77-0.83, P<0.001), and related hospital charges were 24{\%} lower (exponential regression coefficient: 0.76, 95{\%} CI: 0.67-0.87, P<0.001) in the sugammadex group than in the neostigmine group. For patients living ≥50 km from the hospital, the incidence of 30-day unplanned readmission was 68{\%} lower in the sugammadex group than in the neostigmine group (OR: 0.32, 95{\%} CI: 0.13-0.79, P=0.014), while it was not significant for patients living <50 km from the hospital (P=0.319). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with neostigmine, reversal of rocuronium with sugammadex after major abdominal surgery was associated with a lower incidence of 30-day unplanned readmission, a shorter hospital stay, and lower related hospital charges.},

	abstract = {As an anesthetic reversal agent, there are concerns with cholinesterase inhibitors regarding worsening of Parkinson's disease (PD)-related symptoms. Sugammadex, a relatively new reversal agent, does not inhibit acetylcholinesterase and does not require co-administration of an antimuscarinic agent. The present study compared the recovery profiles of 2 agents initially administered for reversal of neuromuscular blockade in patients with advanced PD who underwent deep brain stimulator implantation.A total of 121 patients with PD who underwent deep brain stimulator implantation were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into 1 of 2 groups according to the type of neuromuscular blockade reversal agent (pyridostigmine vs sugammadex) initially administered. Recovery profiles reflecting time to extubation, reversal failure at first attempt, and hemodynamic stability, including incidence of hypertension or tachycardia during the emergence period, were compared.Time to extubation in the sugammadex group was significantly shorter (P < .001). In the sugammadex group, reversal failure at first attempt did not occur in any patient, while it occurred in seven (9.7{\%}) patients in the pyridostigmine group (P = .064), necessitating an additional dose of pyridostigmine (n = 3) or sugammadex (n = 4). The incidence of hemodynamic instability during anesthetic emergence was significantly lower in the sugammadex group than in the pyridostigmine group (P = .019).Sugammadex yielded a recovery profile superior to that of pyridostigmine during the anesthesia emergence period in advanced PD patients. Sugammadex is also likely to be associated with fewer adverse effects than traditional reversal agents, which in turn would also improve overall postoperative management in this patient population.},

	abstract = {BACKROUND: The reversation of NMBA (neuromuscular blocking agents) prevents numerous postoperative complications, increases quality of recovery and decreases the time, expenditure spending in hospital. The choice of medicine used to reverse NMBA depends considered as a key fators to gain the best outcome and to avoid the side effects. AIM: To evaluate the postoperative effect on muscle relaxation reversal and side effects of sugammadex 2 mg/kg versus the combination of neostigmine and atropine sulfate in the living kidney donors. METHODS: A randomised controlled trial on 70 patients undergoing living kidney donation surgery were allocated to 2 groups. Patients in group I (SUGA) were reversed with sugammadex 2 mg/kg and in group II (NEO/ATR) with the combination of neostigmine and atropine sulfat. RESULTS: With 35 patients in each group, the study results showed that after 3 mintutes of reversal patients reaching TOF value ≥0.9 in group SUGA is 91.4{\%}, after 5 minutes 100{\%} of patients in group SUGA reached TOF value ≥0.9 . In group NEO/ATR after 3 minutes 28.6{\%} patients reached TOF ≥0.9 and 40{\%} patients reached TOF≥0.9 after 5 minutes. The difference in percentage of patients reaching TOF ≥0.9 after 3 minutes, 5 minutes of reversal between two groups is significant (p<0.05). After 10 minutes, 100{\%} patients in both group got TOF ≥0.9. Time to exutubation of group SUGA was 249.43 $\pm$81.75 seconds and it was 456.29 $\pm$146.45 seconds in group NEO/ATR. Nausea, bradycardia, and increased phlegm production in group NEO/ATR was 22.9{\%}; 28.5{\%}; 25.7{\%} respectively; while those side effects were not met in group SUGA, the difference was significant (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The muscle relaxation reversal effect of sugammadex was faster than that of neostigmine, the duration TOF ≥0.9 and the time to extubation was significantly faster. Sugammadex did not cause hemodynamic changes before and after muscle relaxation reversal, neostigmine resulted in the bradycardia, increased phlegm secreting and other side effects. The renal function after 24 hours postoperatively of two groups was similar.},

@article{Schepens2019,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of neostigmine after neuromuscular blockade (NMB) has been associated with postoperative respiratory complications. In previous studies, we found lower diaphragmatic activity after neostigmine reversal of NMB, compared to sugammadex. It is still unclear whether the adequate use of neostigmine guarantees normal respiratory muscle function after NMB. In this study, we wanted to assess the effect of commonly used degrees of NMB and their possible reversal strategies on respiratory muscle activity after the return of normal neuromuscular transmission. METHODS: This is a randomized, controlled, parallel-group, single-centre, double-blind study in patients scheduled for intracranial surgery at a tertiary academic hospital in Belgium. All participants received target controlled propofol/remifentanil anesthesia and were randomized into one of five groups, receiving either a shallow NMB with no reversal (shallow/saline), a shallow NMB with sugammadex reversal (shallow/sugammadex), a moderate NMB with neostigmine reversal (moderate/neostigmine), a moderate NMB with sugammadex reversal (moderate/sugammadex), or a deep NMB with sugammadex reversal (deep/sugammadex). Primary and secondary outcome parameters were diaphragm and intercostal electromyographic (EMG) activity at the moment of resumed spontaneous breathing activity, defined as a maximal interval of 10 min after the first spontaneous breath. RESULTS: For the five groups, a total of 55 patients could be included in the final analysis. Median time of spontaneous breathing analyzed was 5 min (IQR 3-9.5 min). Both the moderate/sugammadex and the moderate/neostigmine groups had lower levels of diaphragm EMG compared to the shallow/sugammadex group. The moderate/neostigmine group had lower levels of intercostal EMG activity compared to the shallow/saline group. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the depth of neuromuscular blockade and type of reversal strategy impacts respiratory muscle activity at the moment of resumed spontaneous breathing and recovery of neuromuscular blockade. Both groups that received moderate NMB had lower levels of diaphragm EMG, compared to the shallow NMB group with sugammadex reversal. Compared to the shallow NMB group with no reversal, the moderate NMB with neostigmine reversal group had lower intercostal EMG activity.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To report on postoperative outcomes related to the administration of neostigmine for reversal of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents in cardiovascular surgery patients, with a specific focus on the duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation as the primary endpoint. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study design was followed to achieve the study objectives. SETTING: This was a single-center, chart review study conducted at a large academic medical center of adult patients post-cardiovascular surgery. PARTICIPANTS: Patients were included if they had received a bolus dose of perioperative nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent and underwent one of the targeted cardiovascular surgeries. INTERVENTIONS: Final analysis comprised of 175 patients, 95 of whom received neostigmine and 80 who did not receive neostigmine. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary endpoint was the duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation. When controlling for all covariates, neostigmine use was associated with a 0.34-hour reduction (∼20.4 min) in duration of mechanical ventilation (parameter estimate: 0.66, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.49-0.89; p = 0.0071). More patients who received neostigmine met the early extubation benchmark of less than 6 hours (55 v 34 patients; p = 0.04). Finally, neostigmine use was not found to be associated with increased risk of respiratory complications or postoperative nausea and/or vomiting. CONCLUSIONS: The use of neostigmine was found to have a protective effect on the duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation without increasing the risk of adverse complications.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Residual neuromuscular blockade after surgery is associated with airway obstruction, hypoxia, and respiratory complications. Compared with neostigmine, sugammadex reverses neuromuscular blockade to a train-of-four ratio > 0.9 more rapidly. It is unknown, however, whether the superior reversal profile of sugammadex improves clinically relevant measures of strength in the early postoperative period. METHODS: Patients undergoing general, gynecological, or urologic surgery were randomized to receive either neostigmine (70 µg·kg(-1), maximum 5 mg) or sugammadex (2 or 4 mg·kg(-1)) to reverse neuromuscular blockade. The primary outcome was the ability to breathe deeply measured by incentive spirometry at 30, 60, and 120 min after reversal. RESULTS: We randomized 62 patients to either a neostigmine (n = 31) or sugammadex (n = 31) group. The incentive spirometry volume recovery trajectory was not different between the two groups (P = 0.35). Median spirometry volumes at baseline, 30, 60, and 120 min postoperatively were 2650 vs 2500 mL, 1775 vs 1750 mL, 1375 vs 2000 mL, and 1800 vs 1950 mL for the sugammadex and neostigmine groups, respectively. Postoperative incentive spirometry decrease from baseline was not different between the two groups. Hand grip strength, the ability to sit unaided, train-of-four ratio on postanesthesia care unit (PACU) admission, time to extubation, time to PACU discharge readiness, and Quality of Recovery-15 scores were also not different between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Measures of postoperative strength, such as incentive spirometry, hand group strength, and the ability to sit up in the early postoperative period were not different in patients who received neostigmine or sugammadex for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sugammadex is a novel, rapidly-acting pharmacologic agent to reverse steroidal neuromuscular blocking agents with demonstrated advantages over acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. However, anecdotal reports have noted rare instances of bradycardia and even cardiac arrest. The current study examined heart rate (HR) changes in infants and children with comorbid cardiac, cardiovascular, and congenital heart diseases. METHODS: Patients less than 18 years of age, who had a comorbid cardiac, cardiovascular, or congenital heart disease and were to receive sugammadex, were included in this prospective observational study. After sugammadex administration, HR was continuously monitored and recorded every minute for the first 15 min, and then every 5 min for the next 15 min or until the patient was transferred from the operating room. The primary outcome, bradycardia, was defined as HR below the fifth percentile for age. Secondary outcomes included greatest decrease in HR from baseline for each patient and interventions required for bradycardia. RESULTS: The study cohort included 99 patients (58 male and 41 female) with a median age of 3 years. Bradycardia was noted in 20 of 99 patients (20{\%}); however, six of these patients were bradycardic prior to the administration of sugammadex. Older patients, male patients, and patients with higher body weight were the most likely to experience bradycardia. None of the patients required treatment for bradycardia. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of bradycardia following the administration of sugammadex was low, even in patients with congenital heart disease. Bradycardia was not associated with clinically significant hemodynamic changes and no treatment was required.},

	abstract = {Deep neuromuscular block aims to improve operative conditions during laparoscopic surgery with a lower intra-abdominal pressure. Studies are conflicting on whether meaningful improvements in quality of recovery occur beyond emergence, and whether lower intra-abdominal pressure is achieved. In this pragmatic randomised trial with 1:1 allocation, adults undergoing elective laparoscopic surgery were allocated to moderate neuromuscular block reversed with neostigmine, or deep neuromuscular block reversed with sugammadex. Allocation was revealed to the anaesthetist only. Primary outcome was cognitive recovery of the Postoperative Quality of Recovery Scale, 7 days after surgery. Secondary outcomes included recovery in other domains of the Postoperative Quality of Recovery Scale at 15 min and 40 min; days 1, 3, 7, 14; and 1 and 3 months after surgery. Chi-square test was used for the primary outcome, and generalised linear mixed model for recovery over time between groups. Of 350 participants randomised, 140 (deep) and 144 (moderate) were analysed for the primary outcome. There was no difference in the Postoperative Quality of Recovery Scale cognitive domain at day 7 (deep 92.9{\%} vs. moderate 91.8{\%}, OR 1.164; 95{\%}CI 0.486-2.788, p = 0.826), or at any other time-point. No significant difference was observed for physiological, emotive, activities of daily living, nociception, or overall recovery. Length of stay in the recovery area (mean (SD) deep 108 (58) vs. moderate 109 (57) min, p = 0.78) and hospital (1.8 (1.9) vs. 2.6 (3.5) days, p = 0.019) was not different. Intra-abdominal pressure and surgical operating conditions were not different between groups. Deep neuromuscular block did not improve quality of recovery compared with moderate neuromuscular block in operative laparoscopic surgery over a 1-h duration.},

	abstract = {The extent of neuromuscular blockade during anaesthesia is frequently measured using a train-of-four stimulus. Various monitors have been used to quantify the train-of-four, including mechanomyography, acceleromyography and electromyography. Mechanomyography is often considered to be the laboratory gold standard of measurement, but is not commercially available and has rarely been used in clinical practice. Acceleromyography is currently the most commonly used monitor in the clinical setting, whereas electromyography is not widely available. We compared a prototype electromyograph with a newly constructed mechanomyograph and a commercially available acceleromyograph monitor in 43 anesthetised patients. The mean difference (bias; 95{\%} limits of agreement) in train-of-four ratios was 4.7 (-25.2 to 34.6) for mechanomyography vs. electromyography; 14.9 (-13.0 to 42.8) for acceleromyography vs. electromyography; and 9.8 (-31.8 to 51.3) for acceleromyography vs. mechanomyography. The mean difference (95{\%} limits of agreement) in train-of-four ratios between opposite arms when using electromyography was -0.7 (-20.7 to 19.3). There were significantly more acceleromyography train-of-four values > 1.0 (23{\%}) compared with electromyography or mechanomography (2-4{\%}; p < 0.0001). Electromyography most closely resembled mechanomyographic assessment of neuromuscular blockade, whereas acceleromyography frequently produced train-of-four ratio values > 1.0, complicating the interpretation of acceleromyography results in the clinical setting.},

@article{Deana2020,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rapid neuromuscular block reversal at the end of major abdominal surgery is recommended to avoid any postoperative residual block. To date, no study has evaluated sugammadex performance after rocuronium administration in patients undergoing liver transplantation. This is a randomized controlled trial with the primary objective of assessing the neuromuscular transmission recovery time obtained with sugammadex versus neostigmine after rocuronium induced neuromuscular blockade in patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation. METHODS: The TOF-Watch SX{\textregistered}, calibrated and linked to a portable computer equipped with TOF-Watch SX Monitor Software{\textregistered}, was used to monitor and record intraoperative neuromuscular block maintained with a continuous infusion of rocuronium. Anaesthetic management was standardized as per our institution's internal protocol. At the end of surgery, neuromuscular moderate block reversal was obtained by administration of 2 mg/kg of sugammadex or 50 mcg/kg of neostigmine (plus 10 mcg/kg of atropine). RESULTS: Data from 41 patients undergoing liver transplantation were analysed. In this population, recovery from neuromuscular block was faster following sugammadex administration than neostigmine administration, with mean times$\pm$SD of 9.4 $\pm$4.6 min and 34.6 $\pm$24.9 min, respectively (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Sugammadex is able to reverse neuromuscular block maintained by rocuronium continuous infusion in patients undergoing liver transplantation. The mean reversal time obtained with sugammadex was significantly faster than that for neostigmine. It is important to note that the sugammadex recovery time in this population was found to be considerably longer than in other surgical settings, and should be considered in clinical practice.

	abstract = {The use of sugammadex can reduce post-operative residual neuromuscular blockade, which is known to increase the risk of post-operative respiratory events. However, its effect on post-operative pulmonary complications is not obvious. This study was performed to evaluate the effects of sugammadex on post-operative pulmonary complications in patients undergoing laparoscopic gastrectomy between 2013 and 2017. We performed propensity score matching to correct for selection bias. Post-operative pulmonary complications (i.e., pneumonia, respiratory failure, pleural effusion, atelectasis, pneumothorax, and aspiration pneumonitis) were evaluated from the radiological and laboratory findings. We also evaluated admission to the intensive care unit after surgery, re-admission or an emergency room visit within 30 days after discharge, length of hospital stay, re-operation, and mortality within 90 days post-operatively as secondary outcomes. In the initial cohort of 3802 patients, 541 patients were excluded, and 1232 patients were analyzed after propensity score matching. In the matched cohort, pleural effusion was significantly reduced in the sugammadex group compared to the neostigmine group (neostigmine 23.4{\%} vs. sugammadex 18{\%}, p = 0.02). Other pulmonary complications and secondary outcomes were not significantly different between the groups. In comparison to neostigmine, the use of sugammadex was associated with a lower incidence of post-operative pleural effusion in laparoscopic gastrectomy.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of sugammadex on operating room (OR) times versus neostigmine in patients recovering from rocuronium or vecuronium induced neuromuscular blockade. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study evaluated patients 18 years or older with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status of I-III who received sugammadex or neostigmine (January- October 2017) for reversal of rocuronium or vecuronium at a 500 bed, community hospital. Patients who were pregnant or breastfeeding were excluded. The primary outcome measure was the time from sugammadex or neostigmine administration to OR exit. The primary outcome was evaluated using a linear regression model adjusting for inpatient procedures, age, sex, body mass index, and ASA score. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of bradycardia as well as nausea and vomiting. RESULTS: The baseline characteristics of the patients in the cohort (sugammadex=134, neostigmine=143) were similar. The median time from drug administration to OR exit was similar for neostigmine and sugammadex (16 vs. 15.5 minutes, p=0.11). Sugammadex had a statistically significant reduction in time from drug administration to OR exit (coefficient -2.7 minutes, 95{\%} confidence interval -5.2 to -0.2 minutes) in the multivariable linear regression model. Sugammadex had lower rates of bradycardia (5.6 vs. 2.2{\%}) or nausea and vomiting (18 vs. 11{\%}) that did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Sugammadex had statistically shorter OR exit times after drug administration in the cohort. The mean 2.7 minute benefit is unlikely to be clinically meaningful and limits its application in practice unless larger cohorts detect a benefit due to a significant reduction.in.adverse.events.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Five percent of adult patients undergoing noncardiac inpatient surgery experience a major pulmonary complication. The authors hypothesized that the choice of neuromuscular blockade reversal (neostigmine vs. sugammadex) may be associated with a lower incidence of major pulmonary complications. METHODS: Twelve U.S. Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group hospitals were included in a multicenter observational matched-cohort study of surgical cases between January 2014 and August 2018. Adult patients undergoing elective inpatient noncardiac surgical procedures with general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation receiving a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockade agent and reversal were included. Exact matching criteria included institution, sex, age, comorbidities, obesity, surgical procedure type, and neuromuscular blockade agent (rocuronium vs. vecuronium). Other preoperative and intraoperative factors were compared and adjusted in the case of residual imbalance. The composite primary outcome was major postoperative pulmonary complications, defined as pneumonia, respiratory failure, or other pulmonary complications (including pneumonitis; pulmonary congestion; iatrogenic pulmonary embolism, infarction, or pneumothorax). Secondary outcomes focused on the components of pneumonia and respiratory failure. RESULTS: Of 30,026 patients receiving sugammadex, 22,856 were matched to 22,856 patients receiving neostigmine. Out of 45,712 patients studied, 1,892 (4.1{\%}) were diagnosed with the composite primary outcome (3.5{\%} sugammadex vs. 4.8{\%} neostigmine). A total of 796 (1.7{\%}) patients had pneumonia (1.3{\%} vs. 2.2{\%}), and 582 (1.3{\%}) respiratory failure (0.8{\%} vs. 1.7{\%}). In multivariable analysis, sugammadex administration was associated with a 30{\%} reduced risk of pulmonary complications (adjusted odds ratio, 0.70; 95{\%} CI, 0.63 to 0.77), 47{\%} reduced risk of pneumonia (adjusted odds ratio, 0.53; 95{\%} CI, 0.44 to 0.62), and 55{\%} reduced risk of respiratory failure (adjusted odds ratio, 0.45; 95{\%} CI, 0.37 to 0.56), compared to neostigmine.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pulmonary complications related to residual neuromuscular blockade lead to morbidity and mortality. Using an interrupted time series design, we tested whether proportions of reintubation for respiratory failure or new noninvasive ventilation were changed after a system-wide transition of the standard reversal agent from neostigmine to sugammadex. METHODS: Adult patients undergoing a procedure with general anesthesia that included pharmacologic reversal of neuromuscular blockade and admission ≥1 night were eligible. Groups were determined by date of surgery: August 15, 2015 to May 10, 2016 (presugammadex), and August 15, 2016 to May 11, 2017 (postsugammadex). The period from May 11, 2016 to August 14, 2016 marked the institutional transition (washout/wash-in) from neostigmine to sugammadex. The primary outcome was defined as a composite of reintubation for respiratory failure or new noninvasive ventilation. Event proportions were parsed into 10-day intervals in each cohort, and trend lines were fitted. Segmented logistic regression models appropriate for an interrupted time series design and adjusting for potential confounders were utilized to evaluate the immediate effect of the implementation of sugammadex and on the difference between preintervention and postintervention slopes of the outcomes. Models containing all parameters (full) and only significant parameters (parsimonious) were fitted and are reported. RESULTS: Of 13,031 screened patients, 7316 patients were included. The composite respiratory outcome occurred in 6.1{\%} of the presugammadex group and 4.2{\%} of the postsugammadex group. Adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) for the composite respiratory outcome were 0.795 (95{\%} CI, 0.523-1.208) for the immediate effect of intervention, 0.986 (95{\%} CI, 0.959-1.013) for the difference between preintervention and postintervention slopes in the full model, and 0.667 (95{\%} CI, 0.536-0.830) for the immediate effect of the intervention in the parsimonious model. CONCLUSIONS: The system-wide transition of the standard pharmacologic reversal agent from neostigmine to sugammadex was associated with a reduction in the odds of the composite respiratory outcome. This observation is supported by nonsignificant within-group time trends and a significant reduction in intercept/level from presugammadex to postsugammadex in a parsimonious logistic regression model adjusting for covariates.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Incomplete recovery of neuromuscular blockade is a common postoperative adverse event in the postanaesthesia care unit. OBJECTIVE: We examined and compared the incidence of residual neuromuscular blockade when the recommended dose of neostigmine or sugammadex was administered according to a qualitative nerve stimulator response. DESIGN: A randomised controlled trial. SETTING: A tertiary care hospital in South Korea from September 2017 to November 2017. PATIENTS: Eighty patients aged between 18 and 69 years were included in this study. All were patients scheduled to undergo elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy and who had an American Society of Anaesthesiologists physical status of one or two were eligible. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were allocated randomly to receive neostigmine or sugammadex at the end of surgery. The doses of the reversal agents were based on the response to peripheral nerve stimulation, which was discontinued after administration of the reversal agent. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade. The secondary outcomes were the incidences of symptoms or signs of residual neuromuscular blockade such as hypoxaemia, inability to maintain head-lift for 5 s and diplopia. RESULTS: The incidence of residual neuromuscular blockade on arrival in the recovery room was 44.4{\%} in the neostigmine group and 0{\%} in the sugammadex group (P < 0.0001, relative risk = 1.80, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.36 to 2.41). The incidences of adverse events in the recovery room were low and comparable between the groups. CONCLUSION: The incidence of residual neuromuscular blockade on arrival in the recovery room was significantly higher in the neostigmine group than that in the sugammadex group. However, the incidence of adverse events was similar in the neostigmine and sugammadex groups. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03292965.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sugammadex reduces postoperative complications. We sought to determine whether it could reduce the length of hospital stay, post-anesthetic recovery time, unplanned readmission, and charges for patients who underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) when compared to neostigmine. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study of patients who underwent RALP between July 2012 and July 2017, in whom rocuronium was used as a neuromuscular blocker. The primary outcome was the length of hospital stay after surgery in patients who underwent reversal with sugammadex when compared to those who underwent reversal with neostigmine. The secondary outcomes were post-anesthetic recovery time, hospital charges, and unplanned readmission within 30 days after RALP. RESULTS: In total, 1430 patients were enrolled. Using a generalized linear model in a propensity score-matched cohort, sugammadex use was associated with a 6{\%} decrease in the length of hospital stay (mean: sugammadex 7.7 days vs. neostigmine 8.2 days; odds ratio {$[$}OR{$]$} 0.94, 95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$} {$[$}0.89, 0.98{$]$}, P = 0.008) and an 8{\%} decrease in post-anesthetic recovery time (mean: sugammadex 36.7 min vs. neostigmine 40.2 min; OR 0.92, 95{\%} CI {$[$}0.90, 0.94{$]$}, P < 0.001) as compared to neostigmine use; however, it did not reduce the 30-day unplanned readmission rate (P = 0.288). The anesthesia charges were higher in the sugammadex group than in the neostigmine group (P < 0.001); however, there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of postoperative net charges (P = 0.061) and total charges (P = 0.100). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the reversal of rocuronium effects with neostigmine, reversal with sugammadex after RALP was associated with a shorter hospital stay and post-anesthetic recovery time, and was not associated with 30-day unplanned readmission rates and net charges.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: This objective of this study was to determine if reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade with sugammadex versus neostigmine results in a decreased number of hypoxic episodes in the early postoperative period in patients undergoing thoracic surgery with single lung ventilation. DESIGN: Single-center, randomized, double-blind, two-arm clinical trial. SETTING: Operating room and postanesthesia care unit. PATIENTS: 92 subjects aged ≥18, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status II-IV, and undergoing a thoracic operation necessitating single lung ventilation. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects received either 2 mg/kg sugammadex or 50 μg/kg neostigmine with 8 μg/kg glycopyrrolate for reversal of moderate neuromuscular blockade. MEASUREMENTS: For the first 90 min postoperatively, all episodes of hypoxia were recorded. Neuromuscular monitoring was performed with acceleromyography (TOF-Watch{\textregistered}SX) and the train of four (TOF) was recorded at 2, 5, 10, and 15 min after administration of the neuromuscular reversal agent. MAIN RESULTS: Subjects who received neostigmine had a median of 1 episode (interquartile range IQR: 0-2.2) of hypoxia versus subjects who received sugammadex who had a median of 0 episodes (IQR: 0-1) (p = 0.009). The mean time to recovery of TOF ≥0.9 was significantly faster with sugammadex at 10 min (95{\%} confidence interval CI: 5-15) compared with neostigmine at 40 min (95{\%} CI: 15-53) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In thoracic surgical patients necessitating single lung ventilation, sugammadex provides faster reversal of moderate neuromuscular blockade and results in a decreased number of postoperative hypoxic episodes compared with neostigmine.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing thoracoscopic procedures may be at high-risk for incomplete neuromuscular recovery and associated complications. The aim of this clinical investigation was to assess the incidence of postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade in adult thoracic surgical patients administered neostigmine or sugammadex when optimal dosing and reversal strategies for these agents were used. The effect of choice of reversal agent on hypoxemic events and signs and symptoms of muscle weakness were also determined. Additionally, operative conditions in each group were graded by surgeons performing the procedures. METHODS: Two hundred patients undergoing thoracoscopic surgical procedures were enrolled in this nonrandomized controlled trial. One hundred consecutive patients maintained at moderate levels of neuromuscular blockade were reversed with neostigmine (neostigmine group) followed by 100 consecutive patients given sugammadex to antagonize deeper levels of neuromuscular blockade (sugammadex group). Anesthetic and neuromuscular management were standardized. Surgeons rated operative conditions at the conclusion of the procedure on a 4-point scale (grade 1 = excellent to grade 4 = poor). Train-of-four ratios were measured immediately before extubation and at PACU admission (primary outcomes). Postoperatively, patients were assessed for adverse respiratory events and 11 signs and 16 symptoms of muscle weakness. RESULTS: The 2 groups were similar in intraoperative management characteristics. The percentage of patients with residual neuromuscular blockade, defined as a normalized train-of-four ratio <0.9, was significantly greater in the neostigmine group than the sugammadex group at both tracheal extubation (80{\%} vs 6{\%}, respectively, P < .0001) and PACU admission (61{\%} vs 1{\%}, respectively, P < .0001). Patients in the neostigmine group had less optimal operative conditions (median score 2 {$[$}good{$]$} versus 1 {$[$}excellent{$]$} in the sugammadex group; P < .0001), and more symptoms of muscle weakness were present in these subjects (median number {$[$}interquartile range{$]$} 4 {$[$}1-8{$]$} vs 1 {$[$}0-2{$]$} in the sugammadex group, P < .0001). No differences between groups in adverse airway events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the application of strategies documented to reduce the risk of residual neuromuscular blockade, a high percentage of thoracoscopic patients whose neuromuscular blockade was reversed with neostigmine were admitted to the PACU with clinical evidence of residual paralysis. In contrast, muscle weakness was rarely observed in patients whose neuromuscular blockade was antagonized with sugammadex.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Adequate muscle relaxation and rapid recovery of neuromuscular function are essential in the perioperative period. We therefore compared various anesthetic regimens of neuromuscular blockers and antagonists administered to overweight patients undergoing nasopharyngeal surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS This prospective, randomized, double-blind study was conducted in overweight patients undergoing nasopharyngeal surgery. We randomly assigned 102 patients into 3 groups (each n=34) treated with various muscle relaxant agents and antagonists: rocuronium and sugammadex (Group RS), rocuronium and neostigmine (Group RN), and cisatracurium and neostigmine (Group CN). Then, we compared the efficacy and safety indexes of the 3 groups. RESULTS Onset times of muscular relaxation in Group RS and Group RN (110 s and 120 s) were shorter than in Group CN (183 s). Time from administration of antagonist to recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.9 was shorter in Group RS (3.3 min) than in other groups (20.7 min and 19.1 min, respectively). The incidence of postoperative residual curarization (PORC) was significantly lower in Group RS (5.9{\%}) than in the other 2 groups (both 41.2{\%}). The hemodynamic parameter changes before extubation were significantly higher in Group RN and Group CN than in Group RS. The postoperative pain scores were lowest in Group RS. CONCLUSIONS For overweight patients undergoing nasopharyngeal surgery, the use of rocuronium with sugammadex had the shortest onset time of neuromuscular relaxation, accelerated the reversion of neuromuscular blockade, effectively reduced the occurrence of PORC, relieved postoperative pain, and maintained hemodynamic stability before extubation. The combination of rocuronium and sugammadex may be the best anesthetic regimen for overweight patients undergoing nasopharyngeal surgery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although cases of anaphylaxis caused by sugammadex have been reported, its incidence remains uncertain. Conversely, no studies have evaluated the incidence of anaphylaxis to neostigmine. METHODS: This was a retrospective multicentre observational study of patients who underwent surgery under general anaesthesia between 2012 and 2016 to compare the incidence of anaphylaxis with sugammadex with that of neostigmine at four tertiary hospitals in Japan. To ensure the quality of diagnosis, only cases with a clinical history suggestive of anaphylaxis, along with positive results from in vitro or in vivo testing, were assessed. RESULTS: From a total of 49 532 patients who received general anaesthesia included in this study, 18 cases of anaphylaxis were reported, of which six were attributable to sugammadex and none to neostigmine. There were no fatalities attributable to anaphylaxis. The incidence of anaphylaxis caused by all drugs or by sugammadex was calculated as 0.036{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$}: 0.022-0.057{\%}) and 0.02{\%} (of the number of sugammadex cases) (95{\%} CI: 0.007-0.044{\%}), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that neostigmine might be safer than sugammadex when assessing only the incidence of anaphylaxis. We believe that there is room for reconsideration of the choice of reversal agent for neuromuscular blocking agents by all anaesthetists. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN000022365; UMIN000033561.},

@article{Paredes2020,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: While sugammadex (SGX) is not approved for use in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), its administration in this patient population has been reported. We designed the current study to review all instances of patients with ESRD receiving SGX and to describe their clinical outcomes. METHODS: This is a historical cohort study of 219 patients with chronic kidney disease stage 5 who received SGX in one of three hospital locations within the same academic health system. Data were collected between 7 March 2016 and 1 August 2019 and included demographics, notable events from the anesthesia records, and postoperative complications. The primary outcome included any complication possibly related to SGX such as hypersensitivity reactions, need for reintubation, hypoxemia, pneumonia, and residual neuromuscular blockade. Secondary outcomes included any other complication not included in the primary outcome and/or patient mortality within 30 days after the procedure. RESULTS: No patient experienced a hypersensitivity reaction. Three patients required reintubation while two patients developed hypoxemia that did not require reintubation. One patient developed hospital-acquired pneumonia. Fifty (23{\%}) patients developed other postoperative complications (different from our primary outcome) and nine patients (4{\%}) died during the subsequent 30 postoperative days. None of the primary or secondary outcomes appeared to be related to SGX use. CONCLUSIONS: We provide incremental evidence that SGX could be considered as an alternative neuromuscular blockade reversal agent in patients with ESRD.},

@article{Shaydenfish2020,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The anticholinesterase neostigmine and the muscarinic inhibitor glycopyrrolate are frequently coadministered for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade. This practice can precipitate severe bradycardia or tachycardia, but whether it affects the incidence of cardiovascular complications remains unclear. We hypothesized that anticholinesterase reversal with neostigmine and glycopyrrolate versus no anticholinesterase reversal increases the risk of postoperative cardiovascular complications among adult patients undergoing noncardiac surgery with general anesthesia. METHODS: We conducted a prespecified retrospective analysis of hospital registry data from a major health care network for patients undergoing surgery with general anesthesia from January 2007 to December 2015. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiac dysrhythmia, acute heart failure, transient ischemic attack, ischemic stroke, and acute myocardial infarction within 30 days after surgery. We performed sensitivity analyses in subgroups and propensity score adjustment and explored the association between exposure and outcome in subgroups of patients with high risk of cardiovascular complications. RESULTS: Of the 98,147 cases receiving neuromuscular blockade, 73,181 (74.6{\%}) received neostigmine and glycopyrrolate, while 24,966 (25.4{\%}) did not. A total of 5612 patients (7.7{\%}) in the anticholinesterase reversal group and 1651 (6.6{\%}) in the control group (P < .001) experienced the primary outcome. After adjustment for clinical covariates, neostigmine and glycopyrrolate exposure was significantly associated in a dose-dependent fashion (P for trend <.001, respectively) with tachycardia (adjusted odds ratio = 2.1 {$[$}95{\%} CI, 1.97-2.23{$]$}; P < .001) and bradycardia (adjusted odds ratio = 2.84 {$[$}95{\%} CI, 2.49-3.24{$]$}; P < .001) but not with postoperative cardiovascular complications (adjusted odds ratio = 1.03 {$[$}95{\%} CI, 0.97-1.1{$]$}; P = .33). We identified a significant effect modification of anticholinesterase reversal by high age, high-risk surgery, and history of atrial fibrillation (P for interaction = .002, .001, and .02, respectively). By using linear combinations of main effect and exposure-risk interaction terms, we detected significant associations between anticholinesterase reversal and cardiovascular complications toward a higher vulnerability in these patient subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Neuromuscular blockade reversal with neostigmine and glycopyrrolate was associated with an increased incidence of intraoperative tachycardia and bradycardia but not with 30-day postoperative cardiovascular complications. Exploratory analyses suggest that a high postoperative cardiovascular complication risk profile may modify the effects of anticholinesterase reversal toward clinical relevance.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Residual neuromuscular block has been associated with postoperative pulmonary complications. We hypothesised that sugammadex reduces postoperative pulmonary complications in patients aged ≥70 yr having surgery ≥3 h, compared with neostigmine. METHODS: Patients were enrolled in an open-label, assessor-blinded, randomised, controlled trial. At surgical closure, subjects were equally randomised to receive sugammadex 2 mg kg(-1) or neostigmine 0.07 mg kg(-1) (maximum 5 mg) for rocuronium reversal. The primary endpoint was incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications. Secondary endpoints included residual paralysis (train-of-four ratio <0.9 in the PACU) and Phase 1 recovery (time to attain pain control and stable respiratory, haemodynamic, and neurological status). The analysis was by intention-to-treat. RESULTS: Of the 200 subjects randomised, 98 received sugammadex and 99 received neostigmine. There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint of postoperative pulmonary complications despite a signal towards reduced incidence for sugammadex (33{\%} vs 40{\%}; odds ratio {$[$}OR{$]$}=0.74; 95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$}={$[$}0.40, 1.37{$]$}; P=0.30) compared with neostigmine. Sugammadex decreased residual neuromuscular block (10{\%} vs 49{\%}; OR=0.11, 95{\%} CI={$[$}0.04, 0.25{$]$}; P<0.001). Phase 1 recovery time was comparable between sugammadex (97.3 min {$[$}standard deviation, sd=54.3{$]$}) and neostigmine (110.0 min {$[$}sd=62.0{$]$}), difference -12.7 min (95{\%} CI, {$[$}-29.2, 3.9{$]$}, P=0.13). In an exploratory analysis, there were fewer 30 day hospital readmissions in the sugammadex group compared with the neostigmine group (5{\%} vs 15{\%}; OR=0.30, 95{\%} CI={$[$}0.08, 0.91{$]$}; P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: In older adults undergoing prolonged surgery, sugammadex was associated with a 40{\%} reduction in residual neuromuscular block, a 10{\%} reduction in 30 day hospital readmission rate, but no difference in the occurrence of postoperative pulmonary complications. Based on this exploratory study, larger studies should determine whether sugammadex may reduce postoperative pulmonary complications and 30 day hospital readmissions.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: For some laparoscopic procedures, deep neuromuscular block has been shown to facilitate lower insufflation pressures and lower patient pain scores, and enhance postoperative recovery. We investigated the impact of deep neuromuscular block and its reversal on postoperative shoulder pain and outcomes after robotic prostate surgery. METHODS: Elderly men undergoing robotic prostatectomy were randomised to deep neuromuscular block (target post-tetanic twitch of 1-2 at the facial nerve) with sugammadex reversal or moderate neuromuscular block (target 1-2 train-of-four ratio) with neostigmine reversal. The primary endpoint was postoperative shoulder pain. The secondary endpoints included intraoperative insufflation pressure, surgical rating score, incidence of residual neuromuscular block, and postoperative recovery. RESULTS: A total of 50 subjects for each treatment arm were included in the analysis. The degree of neuromuscular block had no effect on the incidence of shoulder pain (deep block group 12{\%} vs moderate block group 10{\%}; P=1.0) or average insufflation pressure (median {$[$}inter-quartile range{$]$}) (13.3 {$[$}12.5-13.6{$]$} mm Hg vs 13.3 {$[$}11.7-14{$]$} mm Hg, P=0.86). After surgery, the deep block group had a higher normalised train-of-four ratio (0.98 {$[$}0.79-1.11{$]$} vs 0.85 {$[$}0.74-1.00{$]$}; P=0.008). The presence of postoperative shoulder pain was associated with higher BMI (31.8 {$[$}28-33.9{$]$} kg m(-2)vs 28 {$[$}24.8-31.1{$]$} kg m(-2); P=0.036) and longer insufflation time (186 {$[$}156-257{$]$} min vs 154 {$[$}126-198{$]$} min; P=0.028).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Early extubation can reduce pulmonary complications in children undergoing cardiac surgery. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of sugammadex for postoperative respiratory management in children with congenital heart disease. METHODS: Sixty children with congenital heart disease undergoing elective cardiac surgery were divided into group S and group C (30 children in each group). When post tetanic twitches count (PTC) = 1-2 and train-of-four (TOF) = 0, the children in group S received sugammadex4 mg/kg for reversal of neuromuscular block at the end of surgery, and the children in group C received the same volume of normal saline. The recovery time to TOF of 0.9, the mechanical ventilation and extubation times were recorded. On the other side, the hemodynamic parameters before and 5 min after administration, and side effects were also recorded. The levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) before and 24 h after surgery were measured. RESULTS: The recovery time to TOF of 0.9 and extubation time were significantly shorter in the group S than in the group C (4.2 $\pm$1.4 vs 108.2 $\pm$26.7 min, 66.3 $\pm$6.5 vs 171.6 $\pm$23.1 min, respectively, P <  0.01). The CRP and PCT levels were found to be increased in both groups at postoperative 24 h than before surgery. Further, the levels of PCT and CRP at postoperative 24 h were lower in group S when compared to group C (median, 7 vs 17.5 mg/ml, 1.76 vs 5.22 ng/ml, respectively, P <  0.05). There were no statistical differences observed between the two groups (P> 0.05) with respect to side effects. CONCLUSION: Sugammadex is rapid and effective in reversing rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block, and significantly reduces the extubation time and the release of postoperative CRP and PCT in children with congenital heart diseases.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction is a common postoperative complication in elderly patients. In elderly patients, the decline of organ function and neuromuscular junction function make them more sensitive to muscle relaxants. They are more likely to experience residual muscle relaxation after surgery, which may cause various adverse events. Neostigmine, a commonly used muscle relaxant antagonist, can reduce the expression of inflammatory factors, thereby reducing the pro-inflammatory response and neurodegeneration of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus after surgery. The study aimed at observing the effect of different doses of neostigmine on postoperative cognitive function and peripheral inflammatory factors in elderly patients. METHODS: One hundred thirty-two elderly patients who underwent a radical section of gastrointestinal cancer at First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University were divided into neostigmine and saline groups at a 2:1 ratio. Neostigmine was intravenously injected in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) according to the train-of-four ratio (TOFR) T4/T1. When TOFR was ≤0.5, 0.04 mg/kg neostigmine was administered, whereas when TOFR was > 0.5, 0.02 mg/kg neostigmine was injected. The main observation indexes were cognitive function, interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in peripheral blood at the different times before and after the surgery. Secondary observation indicators include the number of atropine injection, extubating time, PACU residence time, incidence of hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and postoperative nausea and vomiting in PACU, time of exhaustion, and length of hospitalization. RESULTS: The extubating and PACU times in 0.04 mg/kg and 0.02 mg/kg groups were significantly shorter than those in the control group (P < 0.001). The incidence of early postoperative cognitive decline in 0.04 mg/kg and 0.02 mg/kg groups was 10 and 15.7{\%}, respectively, which were significantly lower than those in the control group (P = 0.013). CONCLUSION: In elderly patients, 0.02-0.04 mg/kg neostigmine could significantly reduce the incidence of early postoperative cognitive decline without affecting peripheral inflammatory factors.

	abstract = {Introduction: Sugammadex has been shown to be associated with prolongation of prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time. However, it is not known whether it could be associated with enhancing postoperative hypocoagulation. The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of 4 mg/kg of sugammadex on thromboelastography (TEG) parameters in surgical patients. Methods: After Institutional Review Board approval, a prospective double-blinded randomized controlled study was conducted between September 2016 and April 2017. Sixty adult patients scheduled for laparoscopic abdominal surgery were randomly allocated to receive either sugammadex 4 mg/kg (sugammadex group) or pyridostigmine 0.15 mg/kg in combination with glycopyrrolate 0.4 mg (control group) to reverse rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade at the completion of surgery. Blood samples were collected three time points; After the final suture of surgery (baseline) (T1), and at 10 min (T2) and 1 h (T3) after administration of the study drug. Whole blood was analyzed by TEG using TEG 5000 (Hemonetics Corp, Braintree, MA, USA). The primary endpoints were comparison of coagulation time (K, time to 20 mm clot amplitude), R (reaction time), alpha angle, and maximal amplitude (MA) between two groups. Results: Coagulation time was significantly prolonged in sugammadex group after 10 min of the study drug administration compared to control group (mean value 1.3 $\pm$0.4 vs. 1.5 $\pm$0.4, P = 0.03). However, R, alpha angle and MA value were not different between two groups. Conclusions: Sugammadex 4 mg/kg showed an increase in coagulation time in surgical patients. Physician should aware the potential enhancement of hypocoagulation by sugammadex in the setting of high risk of postoperative bleeding.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Catheter-based endovascular neurointerventions require deep neuromuscular blocks during the procedure and rapid subsequent recovery of strength to facilitate neurological evaluation. We tested the primary hypothesis that sugammadex reverses deep neuromuscular blocks faster than neostigmine reverses moderate neuromuscular blocks. METHODS: Patients having catheter-based cerebral neurointerventional procedures were randomized to: (1) deep rocuronium neuromuscular block with posttetanic count 1 to 2 and 4-mg/kg sugammadex as the reversal agent or (2) moderate rocuronium neuromuscular block with train-of-four (TOF) count 1 during the procedure and neuromuscular reversal with 0.07-mg/kg neostigmine to a maximum of 5 mg. Recovery of diaphragmatic function was assessed by ultrasound at baseline before the procedure and 90 minutes thereafter. The primary outcome-time to reach a TOF ratio ≥0.9 after administration of the designated reversal agent-was analyzed with a log-rank test. Secondary outcomes included time to successful tracheal extubation and the difference between postoperative and preoperative diaphragmatic contraction speed and distance. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were randomized to sugammadex and 33 to neostigmine. Baseline characteristics and surgical factors were well balanced. The median time to reach TOF ratio ≥0.9 was 3 minutes (95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$}, 2-3 minutes) in patients given sugammadex versus 8 minutes (95{\%} CI, 6-10 minutes) in patients given neostigmine. Sugammadex was significantly faster by a median of 5 minutes (95{\%} CI, 3-6 minutes; P < .001). However, times to tracheal extubation and diaphragmatic function at 90 minutes did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Sugammadex reversed deep rocuronium neuromuscular blocks considerably faster than neostigmine reversed moderate neuromuscular blocks. However, times to extubation did not differ significantly, apparently because extubation was largely determined by the time required for awaking from general anesthesia and because clinicians were willing to extubate before full neuromuscular recovery. Sugammadex may nonetheless be preferable to procedures that require a deep neuromuscular block and rapid recovery.},

	abstract = {The risk of neuromuscular blockade is certainly minimized by sugammadex in combination with monitoring. However, the effect of sugammadex-aided recovery on patients' satisfaction is unclear. This study compared the Quality of Recovery (QoR)-15 score, which is a patient-reported outcome, in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Eighty patients were randomly assigned to the neostigmine or sugammadex groups. At the end of surgery, neostigmine or sugammadex was administered, and tracheal extubation was performed after confirmation of a train of four ratio ≥0.9. The QoR-15 questionnaire was administered at 1 day before surgery and on post-operative days (POD) 1 and 2. The primary outcome was the QoR-15 score on POD 1. The secondary outcomes were the QoR-15 score on POD 2, modified Aldrete score, length of post-anesthetic care unit stay, post-operative pain, administration of anti-emetics, urinary retention, and length of hospital stay. No significant differences were found in QoR-15 scores on POD 1 (94.4 vs. 95.5, p = 0.87) or 2 (116.3 vs. 122, p = 0.33). Secondary outcomes were also comparable, with the exception of urinary retention (15.8{\%} neostigmine vs. 2.6{\%} sugammadex, p = 0.04). This study demonstrated that the quality of recovery was comparable between the neostigmine and sugammadex groups when reversal and tracheal extubation were performed in accordance with the current guidelines.},

METHODS: Adults with BMI ≥40 kg/m(2) were randomized to 1 of 5 groups: M-neuromuscular block, sugammadex 2 mg/kg ABW; M-neuromuscular block, sugammadex 2 mg/kg IBW; M-neuromuscular block, neostigmine 5 mg, and glycopyrrolate 1 mg; D-neuromuscular block, sugammadex 4 mg/kg ABW; or D-neuromuscular block, sugammadex 4 mg/kg IBW. Supramaximal train of four (TOF) stimulation of the ulnar nerve (TOF-watch SX{\textregistered}) monitored recovery. Primary endpoint was time to TOF ratio ≥0.9 for ABW and IBW groups pooled across neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA)/blocking depth, analyzed by log-rank test stratified for agent and depth. Prespecified safety outcomes included treatment-emergent bradycardia, tachycardia, and other arrhythmias, and adjudicated hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis. RESULTS: Of 207 patients randomized, 188 received treatment (28{\%} male, BMI 47 $\pm$5.1 kg/m(2), age 48 $\pm$13 years). Recovery was 1.5 min faster with ABW vs IBW dosing. The sugammadex 2 mg/kg groups recovered 9-fold faster {$[$}time 0.11-fold, 95{\%} CI 0.08 to 0.14{$]$} than the neostigmine group. ABW (5.3{\%}) and IBW (2.7{\%}) groups had similar incidences of recovery time > 10 min (95{\%} CI of difference: - 4.8 to 11.0{\%}); 84{\%} for neostigmine group. Re-curarization occurred in one patient each in the 2 mg/kg IBW and neostigmine groups. Prespecified safety outcomes occurred with similar incidences. CONCLUSIONS: ABW-based sugammadex dosing yields faster reversal without re-curarization, supporting ABW-based sugammadex dosing in the morbidly obese, irrespective of the depth of neuromuscular block or NMBA used.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reversal of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) at the end of surgery is important for reducing postoperative residual NMB; this is associated with an increased risk of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs). Moreover, PPCs are associated with poor prognosis after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for lobectomy. We compared the effects of two reversal agents, sugammadex and neostigmine, on the incidence of PPCs and duration of hospital stay in patients undergoing VATS lobectomy. METHODS: After VATS lobectomy was completed under neuromuscular monitoring, the sugammadex group (n = 46) received sugammadex 2 mg/kg, while the neostigmine group (n = 47) received neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg with atropine 0.02 mg/kg after at least the third twitch in response to the train of four stimulation. The primary outcome was incidence of PPCs. The secondary outcomes were duration of hospital stay and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the incidence of PPCs for both the sugammadex and neostigmine groups (32.6{\%} and 40.4{\%}, respectively; risk difference = 0.08; 95{\%} confidence interval = {$[$}-0.12, 0.27{$]$}; P = 0.434). The lengths of hospital (P = 0.431) and ICU (P = 0.964) stays were not significantly different between the two groups.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We investigated the efficacy and safety of sugammadex doses calculated using corrected body weight (CBW) for reversing deep rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade (NMB) in morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-five morbidly obese patients were randomly assigned to three groups: (1) a CBW group, n = 50; (2) a total body weight (TBW) group, n = 50; and (3) a control group, n = 25. Deep NMB was maintained using a continuous infusion of rocuronium. At the reappearance of 1 to 2 post-tetanic counts (PTCs), 4 mg/kg sugammadex, calculated using CBW or TBW, were administered. RESULTS: All the participants in the CBW and TBW groups recovered to a train-of-four (TOF) ratio of 0.9 within 5 minutes. The recovery times from the start of sugammadex administration to a TOF ratio of 0.9 were 2.2 $\pm$0.7 and 2.0 $\pm$0.7 minutes in the CBW and TBW groups, respectively. Thus, a sugammadex dose calculated using CBW was not inferior to that calculated using TBW for the reversal of rocuronium-induced deep NMB in morbidly obese patients. CONCLUSION: A dose of 4 mg/kg of sugammadex calculated using CBW is efficient and safe for the reversal of deep NMB after a continuous infusion of rocuronium in morbidly obese patients.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sugammadex for fast-track surgery in children undergoing cardiac surgery. DESIGN: This was a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical study. SETTING: University hospital. PARTICIPANTS: The study comprised 60 children undergoing cardiac surgery. INTERVENTIONS: The children in group S received sugammadex, 4 mg/kg, for reversal of neuromuscular block, and the children in group N received neostigmine, 30 µg/kg, and atropine, 15 µg/kg. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The recovery time to a train-of-four of 0.9 and extubation time were significantly shorter in the group S than in group N (3.4 $\pm$1.2 min v 76.2 $\pm$20.5 min and 31.0 $\pm$6.4 min v 125.2 $\pm$21.6 min, respectively; p < 0.01). The heart rate after drug administration was higher in group S than in group N (102.7 $\pm$9.4 beats/min v 96.9 $\pm$8.5 beats/min; p = 0.03), whereas the mean arterial pressure after drug administration was similar in both groups. The length of hospital stay was shorter in group S (5.8 $\pm$1.0 v 6.5 $\pm$0.9 days; p = 0.03), and the hospitalization expenses were decreased in group S compared with that of group N ({\$}1,036 $\pm${\$}114 v {\$}1,286 $\pm${\$}187; p < 0.01). The incidence of postoperative atelectasis was less in group S than in group N (0 v 20{\%}; p = 0.024). CONCLUSION: Sugammadex can shorten the extubation time and reduce the incidence of postoperative atelectasis, with fewer adverse events, in children undergoing cardiac surgery. It may be beneficial to use sugammadex for fast-track surgery in children undergoing cardiac surgery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sugammadex is associated with few postoperative complications. Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC) are related to prolonged hospitalizations. Present study explored whether the use of sugammadex could reduce PPCs and thereby reduce hospital length of stay (LOS) after lung surgery. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent elective open lobectomy for lung cancer from January 2010 to December 2015. Patients were divided into the sugammadex group and pyridostigmine group. The primary outcome was hospital LOS and secondary outcomes were postoperative complications and overall survival at 1 year. The cohort was subdivided into patients with and without prolonged LOS to explore the effects of sugammadex on outcomes in each group. Risk factors for LOS were determined via multivariate analyses. After propensity score matching, 127 patients were assigned to each group. RESULTS: Median hospital LOS was shorter (10.0 vs. 12.0 days) and the incidence of postoperative atelectasis was lower (18.1 vs. 29.9{\%}) in the sugammadex group. However, no significant difference in overall survival between the groups was seen over 1 year (hazard ratio, 0.967; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.363 to 2.577). Sugammadex was a predictor related to LOS (exponential coefficient 0.88; 95{\%} CI 0.82-0.95). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that sugammadex is a preferable agent for neuromuscular blockade (NMB) reversal than cholinesterase inhibitors in this patient population.

@article{Yu2021,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) requires particular surgical conditions, such as carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum and steep Trendelenburg positioning, which may have adverse effects on the respiratory system. The effect of sugammadex on postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) is controversial. Therefore, we evaluated the incidence of PPCs according to the type of neuromuscular blockade reversal agents in RALP. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed RALP patients. We compared the incidence of PPCs between patients receiving neostigmine (neostigmine group) and those receiving sugammadex (sugammadex group) as a neuromuscular blockade reversal agent. Propensity score-matched analysis was performed. Other postoperative outcomes, such as duration of hospital stays, major adverse cardiac events during hospital stays, and death during hospital stays, were also compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The incidence of PPCs was 28.9{\%} (137/474) in RALP. The incidence of PPCs was significantly lower in the sugammadex group than in the neostigmine group (18.6{\%} {$[$}44/237{$]$} vs. 39.2{\%} {$[$}93/237{$]$}, p < 0.001). The incidence of atelectasis was significantly lower in the sugammadex group than in the neostigmine group (18.6{\%} vs. 39.2{\%}, p < 0.001). The incidence of pneumonia was not significantly different between the sugammadex and neostigmine groups after RALP (0.0{\%} vs. 0.4{\%}, p > 0.999). Besides these, other postoperative outcomes were not significantly different between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of PPCs after RALP was significantly lower in patients receiving sugammadex than in those receiving neostigmine. These results can provide useful information on the appropriate selection of neuromuscular blockade reversal agents in RALP.},

	abstract = {Background: Sugammadex is a modified cyclodextrin that is being increasingly used in anesthetic practice worldwide for the reversal of the aminosteroid neuromuscular blockers rocuronium and vecuronium. Its safety profile, however, is incompletely understood. One such aspect is the incidence of anaphylactic reactions that occur after its administration. While several case reports exist in the literature, there is a paucity of information on the actual incidence of anaphylactic reactions. METHODS: A single-center retrospective chart review identified patients who experienced anaphylaxis to sugammadex in the institutional electronic medical record system. These charts were then reviewed to determine whether the etiology of anaphylaxis was sugammadex administration. RESULTS: Two patients experienced anaphylaxis to sugammadex, which occurred in a single institution cohort of 19,821 patients who received 23,446 total doses. This rate is markedly lower than the 1/300 that the manufacturer's package insert states and also lower than the 1/2500 that the only other large cohort study performed has reported. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of anaphylaxis to sugammadex in this cohort of patients was 2 of 19,821 patients, who received a total of 23,446 doses.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Sugammadex rapidly reverses muscle relaxation compared to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. The long-term outcomes of sugammadex, however, are not well known. We compared 30-day postoperative outcomes following sugammadex and acetylcholinesterase inhibitor use in colorectal surgery patients. Patients and methods: Colorectal surgical patients older than 21 were included in this retrospective study, and were dichotomized according to use of reversal agents, sugammadex (group S), and acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (group A). We assessed 30-day postoperative outcomes, including total length of hospital stay, length of postoperative hospital stay, readmission rate, and delayed discharge rate. Additional parameters included postanesthetic care unit stay time, time to first successful oral intake, unforeseen intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate, postoperative pulmonary complications, and mortality. Results: Among a total of 585 patients, 157 patients remained in each group after propensity score matching. Total length of hospital stay, length of postoperative hospital stay, and readmission rates did not differ between the two groups, while the incidence of delayed discharge was significantly lower in group S (23 (15{\%}) vs. 40 (25{\%}), p = 0.017). Other outcomes did not differ between the two groups. Conclusion: We found no difference in 30-day postoperative outcomes following sugammadex and acetylcholinesterase inhibitor use. The only difference between these treatments was the associated incidence of delayed discharge, which was lower in group S.},

	abstract = {Background: This study aimed to retrospectively evaluate the use of sugammadex in patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy. Methods: Data were obtained from medical record review of patients who underwent VATS lobectomy from January 2013 to November 2014. Fifty patients were divided into two groups: the sugammadex group (group S, n = 19) was administered sugammadex 2 mg/kg, while the pyridostigmine group (group P, n = 31) received pyridostigmine 20 mg with glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg or atropine 0.5 mg. The primary endpoint measure was the overall incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications including prolonged air leak, pneumonia, and atelectasis. The secondary endpoint measures were the length of postoperative hospital stay and duration of chest tube insertion. Results: The overall incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications in patients in group S was significantly lower compared with that of group P (5 {$[$}26.3{\%}{$]$} vs. 17 {$[$}54.8{\%}{$]$}; P = 0.049). Also, the durations of chest tube insertion (5.0 {$[$}4.0--7.0{$]$} vs. 7.0 {$[$}6.0--8.0{$]$} days; P = 0.014) and postoperative hospital stay (8.0 {$[$}8.0--10.0{$]$} vs. 10.0 {$[$}9.0--11.0{$]$} days; P = 0.019) were shorter in group S compared with group P. Administration of sugammadex was associated reduced with postoperative pulmonary complications (OR: 0.22; 95{\%} CI: 0.05--0.87; P = 0.031). Conclusions: The use of sugammadex, compared with pyridostigmine, showed a significantly reduced overall incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications and decreased duration of chest tube use and postoperative hospital stay in patients undergoing VATS lobectomy, suggesting that sugammadex might be helpful in improving clinical outcomes in such patients.},

	abstract = {Introduction: The aim of this study was to compare sugammadex and neostigmine in terms of reversing time, recovery time and extubation time in reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block in patients undergoing lung resection surgery. Method: A total of 60 patients under 75 years of age with an ASA status of II-III undergoing elective pulmonary resection (lobectomy, pneumectomy, wedge resection) who had adequate left ventricle function (EF >40{\%}), normal renal, hepatic, and mental functions, were included in this study Patients were assigned into neostigmine (Group N, n=30) and sugammadex (Grup S, n=30) groups. Results: Time from starting of neuromuscular blockade reversing agent till reaching TOF>0.9 was significantly shorter in Group S (p=0.001). Similarly, extubation time and recovery time were significantly shorter in Group S (p=0.05; p=0.012, respectively). No statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of the operation time and duration of ICU stay. Postoperative complications were similar in both groups. Postoperative residual curarisation was not observed in both groups. Conclusion: In lung resection surgery, sugammadex appears to be a superior selective relaxant binding agent as compared to neostigmine in the reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block with earlier recovery and earlier achievement of TOF ratio of 0.9.},

	abstract = {Introduction Sugammadex is an efficient reversal agent at any time, after neuromuscular blockade. It provides complete reversal for light or deep block facilitating rapid airway control and decreases anesthesia recovery period in outpatient surgeries in children. Patient and methods After ethical committee approval, informed consent and sample size calculation, 70 patients planned for outpatient total bilateral tonsillectomy were divided randomly into 2 groups. Group S (n = 35) received 2 mg/kg sugammadex to reversing NMB achieved by rocuronium. Group N (n = 35) received 0.05 mg/kg neostigmine and atropine sulfate 0.01 mg/kg, and extubation time (time from administration of reversal agent to time of extubation), train-of-four ratio, time to reach train-of-four >0.9, and side effects were recorded. Results There was no significant difference in demographic variables. TOF ratio after reversing was a statistically less in group S than in group N (p < 0.05). The time when TOF rate exceeded 0.9 and extubation time were less in group S than in group N with significant difference (p < 0.05). No adverse effect was recorded in both groups. Conclusions Sugammadex has created a novel rapid, effective and reliable retrieval from NMB with rocuronium in children undergoing tonsillectomy with no side effects.},

	abstract = {Abdominal surgery in obese patients may be associated with pulmonary morbidity, and mortality. Some patients may arrive in the PACU with residual paralysis. The purpose of this study was to find out if there was an association between the type of muscle relaxant reversal agent and the development of postoperative respiratory events in patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy surgery. Methods: From September 2012 to February 2013, in a prospective randomized pilot study, two different muscle relaxant reversal agents were administered at the end of surgery in 57 patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy: sugammadex 2 mg/kg (32 patients) vs. neostigmine 2.5 mg (25 patients). We compared the occurrence of early and late respiratory events/complications by the type of reversal agent. Postoperative respiratory rate, oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2), number of patients with SpO2 lower than 95{\%} in PACU, the minimum value of SpO2 in PACU, train-of four counts (TOF) before reversal, unexpected ICU admissions, duration of hospitalization and incidence of reintubation were recorded. Results: SpO2 in the PACU was significantly lower in the neostigmine group - 95.80 ($\pm$0.014)) vs. in sugammadex group - 96.72 ($\pm$0.011) (p < 0.01), despite a lower TOF count measured in the sugammadex group before reversal, meaning a deeper level of residual relaxation in this group before the administration of the reversal agent (2.53 $\pm$0.98 vs. 3.48 $\pm$0.58 p < 0.01). Also, the minimal SpO2 was significantly lower in the PACU in the neostigmine group: 93{\%} vs. 94{\%} (p = 0.01). Respiratory rates were not different. After the administration of reversal, both groups had TOF counts of 4 with no fade assessed visually. There were no postoperative respiratory events or complications. Conclusions: The use of sugammadex (as compared to neostigmine) as a reversal agent following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy surgery was associated with higher postoperative SpO2 despite the lower TOF count before the administration of reversal agent. Despite the statistical difference in SpO2, its clinical importance seems to be minimal. The lack of difference in the other measured variables may stem from the small number of patients studied (pilot).},

	abstract = {Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) are still required for the pediatric population. Residual neuromuscular block is a common complication in the early postoperative period. The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of sugammadex versus neostigmine for reversing NMB in pediatric patients with cancer who undergo outpatient surgical procedures. This double-blinded study included 80 children with different oncological diagnoses, aged 2-18 years, scheduled for outpatient surgical procedures. They were randomly divided into two equal groups; Group N received neostigmine 0.03 mg/kg with atropine 0.02 mg/kg and Group S received sugammadex 2 mg/kg at the end of surgery. The patients were clinically assessed for NMB recovery and extubated. The primary outcome measure was the time from NMB reversal to recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.9{\%} (recovery time). The secondary outcomes included the time between reversal injection and extubation (extubation time) and possible adverse events. The time to recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.9 and the time between reversal injection and extubation were significantly shorter in S Group (p< 0.001). The time to reach TOF ratio of 0.9 was not correlated with age, anesthesia time, or the dose of the neuromuscular blocker. None of the children developed respiratory depression or postoperative residual curarization. Relatively few patients developed arrhythmia, hypotension, and nausea and vomiting with no significant difference between the two groups. Sugammadex is a good alternative to neostigmine for reversal of neuromuscular block in outpatient surgical procedures in children with cancer; it safely provides faster NMB reversal and extubation time.},

Here, we compared the effects of sugammadex, neostigmine, and pyridostigmine on PONV by means of a five hospital analysis with propensity score matching. We analyzed adults aged ≥18 years who underwent general anesthesia between January 2014 and December 2019. Following propensity score matching, 7793 patients were included in each of the neostigmine and sugammadex matched patient groups (absolute standardized difference (ASD), 0.01--0.07), and 10,197 patients were included in each of the pyridostigmine and sugammadex matched patient groups (ASD, 0.01--0.02), while 19,377 patients were included in each of the pyridostigmine and neostigmine matched patient groups. (ASD, 0.01--0.19). The odds of PONV were low in the sugammadex group (odds ratio, 0.65; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.59--0.72; p < 0.0001) and pyridostigmine group (odds ratio, 0.22; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.20--0.24; p < 0.0001) compared to the neostigmine group, while there was no difference between sugammadex and pyridostigmine (odds ratio, 0.95; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.86--1.04; p = 0.281). Therefore, sugammadex and pyridostigmine may lower the incidence of PONV compared to neostigmine in patients undergoing general anesthesia.},

@article{Kurcaloglu2020,
	abstract = {Neuromuscular recovery (NMR) is a critical part of recovery from general anesthesia. Neostigmine is a choline esterase inhibitor and one of the leading agents which are used for NMR from non-depolarizing neuromuscular block. Its effect depends on competitive antagonism of the neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) in the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Sugammadex is a new agent which has attracted attention with dramatically rapid NMR from non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (NDNMBAs). It effects via chemically antagonizing NMBAs. In this study, effects of neostigmine and sugammadex concerning recovery from general anesthesia for intracranial mass excision operations were compared. Totally 60 patients were included in the study. Neostigmine was used for 30 patients, and sugammadex was used for 30 patients. Evaluation criteria were the train of four (TOF), bispectral index (BIS), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Modified Aldrete Score (MAS), Ramsey Sedation Score (RSS), vital signs and existed complications. It is observed that NMR and recovery from anesthesia were significantly shorter in the sugammadex group (p<0,05). It is also seen that the duration of attaining BIS level to 80 was significantly shorter in the sugammadex group but this result is attributed to the artifact of the rapidly increasing neuromuscular activity in the sugammadex group. Conclusion: We suggest that both neostigmine and sugammadex are useful agents for NMR. Sugammadex has mor e advantages than neostigmine because of rapid onset of action without increased complications but much more studies are needed about sugammadex to take the place of neostigmine.},

	abstract = {Background: Residual neuromuscular block is associated with an increased risk of postoperative pulmonary complications in retrospective studies. The aim of our study was to investigate prospectively the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications after reversal with either sugammadex (SUG) or neostigmine (NEO) in high-risk older patients. Methods: We randomly allocated 180 older patients with significant morbidity (ASA physical status 3) ≥75 yr old to reversal of rocuronium with either SUG or NEO. Adverse events in the recovery room and pulmonary complications (defined by a 5-point {$[$}0--4; 0=best to 4=worst{$]$} outcome score) on postoperative Days 1, 3, and 7 were compared between groups. Results: Data from 168 patients aged 80 (4) yr were analysed; SUG vs NEO resulted in a reduced probability (0.052 vs 0.122) of increased pulmonary outcome score (impaired outcome) on postoperative Day 7, but not on Days 1 and 3. More patients in the NEO group were diagnosed with radiographically confirmed pneumonia (9.6{\%} vs 2.4{\%}; P=0.046). The NEO group showed a non-significant trend towards longer hospital length of stay across all individual centres (combined 9 vs 7.5 days), with a significant difference in Malaysia (6 vs 4 days; P=0.011). Conclusions: Reversal of rocuronium neuromuscular block with SUG resulted in a small, but possibly clinically relevant improvement in pulmonary outcome in a select cohort of high-risk older patients.

	abstract = {Background: Postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade related to nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents may be associated with pulmonary complications. In this study, the authors sought to determine whether sugammadex was associated with a lower risk of postoperative pulmonary complications in comparison with neostigmine. Methods: Adult patients from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database who underwent general anesthesia procedures between January 2010 and July 2019 were included in an observational cohort study. In early 2017, a wholesale switch from neostigmine to sugammadex occurred at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The authors therefore identified all patients receiving nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockades and reversal with neostigmine or sugammadex. An inverse probability of treatment weighting propensity score analysis approach was applied to control for measured confounding. The primary outcome was postoperative pulmonary complications, determined by retrospective chart review and defined as the composite of the three postoperative respiratory occurrences: pneumonia, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and unplanned intubation. Results: Of 10,491 eligible cases, 7,800 patients received neostigmine, and 2,691 received sugammadex. A total of 575 (5.5{\%}) patients experienced postoperative pulmonary complications (5.9{\%} neostigmine vs. 4.2{\%} sugammadex). Specifically, 306 (2.9{\%}) patients had pneumonia (3.2{\%} vs. 2.1{\%}), 113 (1.1{\%}) prolonged mechanical ventilation (1.1{\%} vs. 1.1{\%}), and 156 (1.5{\%}) unplanned intubation (1.6{\%} vs. 1.0{\%}). After propensity score adjustment, the authors found a lower absolute incidence rate of postoperative pulmonary complications over time (adjusted odds ratio, 0.91 {$[$}per year{$]$}; 95{\%} CI, 0.87 to 0.96; P <.001). No difference was observed on the odds of postoperative pulmonary complications in patients receiving sugammadex in comparison with neostigmine (adjusted odds ratio, 0.89; 95{\%} CI, 0.65 to 1.22; P = 0.468). Conclusions: Among 10,491 patients at a single academic tertiary care center, the authors found that switching neuromuscular blockade reversal agents was not associated with the occurrence of postoperative pulmonary complications.},

	abstract = {Objective: Sinonasal surgery is one of the shared airway surgeries that are not uncommonly complicated intra or postoperatively. The proper anesthetic management of these cases plays a crucial role creating a bloodless field. Sugammadex is a new selective relaxant binding drug as it provides a rapid decrease in free rocuronium in the plasma and at nicotinic receptor that help proper awakening of these patients which is extremely important for minimizing the postoperative respiratory complications. The aim of this study is to compare recovery profile in sinonasal surgery in patients reversed by conventional anticholine esterase (Neostigmine) versus those reversed by Sugammadex. Methods: This study included 40 patients ASA physical status I and II aged 20-45 years with chronic sinusitis undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery with or without septoplasty, hypotensive anesthesia to maintain MAP (50-60 mm Hg), muscle relaxation throughout the procedure at 1-2 posttetanic count (PTCs) by rocuronium infusion, and anesthetic depth maintained using BIS (50-60). Patients were allocated randomly into two equal groups to receive either Sugammadex 4 mg/kg (group I) or Neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and atropine 0.02 mg/kg (group II) as a reversal agent, and assessment of postoperative respiratory complications was performed using the Postoperative Respiratory System Evaluation Score (PRSES) at 1st and 5th minutes after extubation. Results: The reversal time showed highly significant difference between the two groups. Patients in the Sugammadex group could reach a TOF of 0.9 in a mean time 2.47 (0.51) min versus 24.21 (4.7) min for the Neostigmine group; postoperative respiratory complications, the Sugammadex group and the Neostigmine group did not differ statistically; however, more patients in Neostigmine group showed respiratory complications at 1st and 5th minutes after extubation as shown by PRSES Scoring System. Conclusion: This study showed that the use of Sugammadex in reversing rocuronium induced neuromuscular block in patients undergoing functional endoscopic surgery is superior to Neostigmine. Further studies are required to weigh the cost benefit relationship of the use of Sugammadex in routine clinical practice. {\copyright}2012 Egyptian Society of Anesthesiologists.

	abstract = {Sugammadex provides a rapid pharmacological reversal of aminosteroid, as well as fewer pulmonary complications, a better physiological recovery, and shorter stays in the postanesthetic recovery unit (PACU). This retrospective analysis of our Centricity anesthesia database in 2017--2019 assessed the efficiency of sugammadex in real-life situations in two groups of surgical cancer patients (breast and abdominal surgery) based on the extubation time, operating room exit time, and length of PACU stay. Overall, 382 anesthesia records (131 breast and 251 abdominal surgeries) were extracted for the pharmacological reversal of neuromuscular blockades by neostigmine or sugammadex. Sugammadex was used for reversal in 91 breast and 204 abdominal surgeries. Sugam-madex use did not affect the extubation time, operating room exit time, or length of PACU stay. However, the time to reach a 90{\%} train of four (TOF) recovery was significantly faster in sugam-madex patients: 2 min (1.5--8) in breast surgery and 2 min (1.5--7) in abdominal surgery versus 10 (6--20) and 9 min (5--20), respectively, for neostigmine (p < 0.05). Most patients who were reversed with sugammadex (91{\%}) reached a TOF ratio of at least 90{\%}, while 54{\%} of neostigmine patients had a 90{\%} TOF ratio recorded (p < 0.05). Factors other than pharmacological reversal probably influence the extubation time, operating room exit time, or PACU stay; however, sugammadex reliably short-ened the time so as to reach a 90{\%} TOF ratio with a better level of reversal.},

	abstract = {Sugammadex can rapidly reverse neuromuscular blockade and has several advantages over cholinesterase inhibitors. It is unclear, however, whether administration of sugammadex in the absence of intraoperative deep neuromuscular blockade has direct clinical benefits. The present study retrospectively assessed the ability of sugammadex to prevent post-operative respiratory adverse events in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery in the absence of routine deep neuromuscular blockade. The medical records of patients who underwent laparoscopic colorectal surgery from 2014 to 2018 in a tertiary care hospital were reviewed. Patients who underwent reversal of neuromuscular blockade with sugammadex or pyridostigmine were subjected to propensity score matching. To assess their relative effects on post-operative adverse respiratory events (defined as a composite of SpO2 < 94{\%} in the post-anesthesia care unit, additional oxygen supplementation during ward transfer or stay, and emergency use of sugammadex in the post-anesthesia care unit), the incidence of these effects was compared in propensity score matched groups of patients treated with sugammadex or pyridostigmine. Of the 602 patients, 210 remained in each group after propensity score matching. The incidence of post-operative respiratory adverse events did not differ significantly in the two groups. These findings suggest that the unrestricted administration of sugammadex not preceded by intra-operative deep neuromuscular blockade does not have clinical benefits, when compared with pyridostigmine, in preventing post-operative respiratory adverse events.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative residual curarization is a preventable cause of postoperative morbidity. Although sugammadex has been shown to reduce the risk of residual curarization, it has not yet been shown if this directly translates to a reduction in morbidity. We aimed to demonstrate whether the introduction of unrestricted sugammadex for routine reversal changed the incidence of postoperative respiratory diagnoses and the rate of airway and respiratory complications in the postoperative care unit. METHODS: A historical cohort study of 1257 patients who underwent general surgical or ear, nose and throat procedures before and after the introduction of unrestricted availability of sugammadex. Patient records were used to identify the incidence of postoperative in-hospital respiratory diagnoses and of airway complications in post-anesthesia care unit, the pattern of muscle relaxant use and the relative costs associated with the routine availability of sugammadex. RESULTS: Unrestricted sugammadex availability was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of a postoperative in-hospital respiratory diagnosis (odds ratio {$[$}OR{$]$} 0.20; 95{\%} CI: 0.05-0.72, P=0.01). Furthermore, the use of sugammadex itself was also associated with a reduction in in-hospital respiratory diagnoses (OR=0.26; 95{\%} CI: 0.08-0.94, P=0.04). Unrestricted sugammadex was also associated with a decrease in the need for manual airway support in the recovery room (3.2{\%} vs. 1.1{\%}, P=0.02) and a decrease in patients being transferred intubated to ICU (5.5{\%} vs. 1.3{\%}, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Unrestricted sugammadex availability is associated with a reduction in postoperative respiratory complications. A well-designed, prospective randomized trial is needed to provide further validation of the data.},

@article{Pecek2015,
	abstract = {Background and Goal of Study: Sugammadex is a selective binding agent that binds aminosteroid muscle relaxants. Each molecule of sugammadex binds one molecule of muscle relaxant. To produce the same depth of the neuromuscular block (NMB) much less molecules of vecuronium are needed than molecules of rocuronium. In theory less sugammadex would be needed to neutralize the neuromuscular block if vecuronium was used to produce the neuromuscular block. Our aim was to compare reversal of vecuronium induced muscle relaxation between a new way of dosing sugammadex, which takes into account TOF value at the end of the surgery and the amount of vecuronium given during the surgery with neostigmine atropine combination. We also wanted to know how much this dosage regime can save compared to standard per kg dosage. Materials and Methods: 20 adult patients requiring a general anesthesia for surgery were analyzed. The first group of 11 patients (SUG) received sugammadex at the end of the surgery according to the table one for NMB reversal. The second group of 9 patients (NEO) received neostigmine and atropine. Train of four (TOF) value was recorded at the end of the surgery and then continuously until the TOF value reached more than 0.9 and the patient was extubated. The time required for the TOF value reaching 0.9 was compared between the groups. For economical evaluation we compared the amount of sugammadex used in the SUG group to standard sugammadex per kg dosage. Results and Discussion: Mean time to recovery to a TOF ratio of 0.9 with sugammadex was 5.12 min versus 12.6 min with neostigmine atropine (P < 0.05). No sign of postoperative residual curarisation was observed in the SUG group. For patients in our study 530 mg of sugammadex were used to neutralize the NMB. If standard per kg sugammadex dosing had been used we would have used 2420 mg for the NMB reversal. Conclusion(s): New dosing for sugammadex was successful in neutralizing the NMB regardless of the TOF value at the end of the surgery. The economic impact of the proposed dosing is significant as an average cost for the vecuronium NMB reversal is reduced from around 80 €to 20 €per patient.},

Septoplasty is a common surgical procedure with postoperative respiratory complications and bleeding. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of sugammadex on postoperative coagulation parameters and bleeding after septoplasty procedure. Material/Methods: In this randomized controlled study, fifty patients were grouped into two groups; neostigmine (Group N) vs. sugammadex (Group S). For the evaluation of PT, aPTT and INR, blood samples were taken for at the postoperative 120th minutes and alteration of these values with respect to preoperative values were documented. Postoperative bleeding was measured by evaluating the amount of blood absorbed on the nasal tip dressing during 3 hours postoperatively. Results: Postoperative bleeding amount was significantly higher in the Group S compared to Group N (p=0.013). No significant difference was observed between two groups according to coagulation parameters (PT; p=0.953, aPTT; p=0.734, INR; p=0.612). Conclusions: Sugammadex was associated with higher amount of postoperative bleeding than neostigmine in septoplasty patients. In surgical procedures having high risk of bleeding the safety of sugammadex need to be verified.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Using sugammadex allows to quickly reverse deep neuromuscular blockade with rocuronium in laparoscopic surgery, which results in great benefits during and after surgery by minimizing the problem of postoperative residual curarization. AIM: The aims of this study are comparing the efficacy of reversing neuromuscular blockade between sugammadex and neostigmine and evaluating its unwanted effects after laparoscopic abdominal surgery. METHODS: Subject of this prospective clinical comparative trial was patients who underwent abdominal laparoscopic surgery at 103 Military Hospital from October 2017 to October 2018. Eighty-four patients suffering from abdominal laparoscopic surgery under deep neuromuscular blockade were enrolled and divided randomly into two groups with 42 patients in each: Group N used neostigmine for neuromuscular blockade reversal and Group S applied sugammadex. At the end of surgery, neuromuscular blockade was reversed with either sugammadex or neostigmine. RESULTS: The reversal time to achieve train-of-four ratio >0.9 in the sugammadex group was 2.42 $\pm$0.58 min, which was shorter than in the neostigmine group (11.83 $\pm$2.19 min) (p < 0.05). The time until extubation in the sugammadex group was 3.69 $\pm$0.67 min, which was shorter than in the neostigmine group 11.90 $\pm$2.22 min (p < 0.05). Reversal with sugammadex resulted in statistical significance of less sputum production (0{\%} vs. 11.9{\%}), dry mouth (0{\%} vs. 28.57{\%}), headache (2.38{\%} vs. 7.14{\%}), and nausea (4.76{\%} vs. 14.28{\%}) compared with neostigmine. However, 26.19{\%} of patients in the neostigmine group presented bradycardia, whereas the concurrent administration of atropine in the neostigmine group resulted in increased heart rate. CONCLUSION: Sugammadex reversed neuromuscular blockade more rapidly and effectively than neostigmine in abdominal laparoscopic surgeries. The unwanted effects of sugammadex group were fewer than neostigmine group.},

	abstract = {Background: Sugammadex has been a revolutionary reversal of neuromuscular blockade. It is known to be highly efficient. However, a change in the coagulation profile is one of the most dangerous potential complications which is a concern for both surgeon and anesthetist. Bleeding may cause hypovolemic shock, hematoma, and so on. To investigate the effects of sugammadex on coagulation profiles in patients with thyroidectomy, we compared patients that were treated with either sugammadex or neostigmine. Patients and Methods: Eighty patients with thyroid neoplasms undergoing thyroidectomy were randomly allocated to sugammadex group (group S) or neostigmine group (group N). Induction of anesthesia was preformed using propofol, sufentanil, and rocuronium. Group S received sugammadex 2.0mg/kg after trachea intubation, similarly Group N received neostigmine 40 µg/kg, for reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade. The intraoperative coagulation profiles were monitored after the rocuronium injection (T0), 10 minutes after reversal (T1) and 30 minutes after reversal (T2) by testing activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen (FIB), thrombin time (TT), and TEG-Haemonetics. Amount of bleeding was recorded during perioperative period. Results: There was no significant difference in the thromboelastogram, APTT, PT, FIB, or TT measurements at each time point in Group N. The reaction time (R time) and kinetics time (K time) of Group S in T1 were significantly longer than the corresponding times at T0 and T2, and the R times were significantly longer than those in Group N at the same time points (P<0.05). Additionally, in Group S, the APTT was prolonged in T1 and returned to normal in T2. Conclusion: The result showed that sugammadex provided transient efficacy in prolonging the coagulation parameters, while neostigmine did not change the coagulation profile.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Sugammadex allows for rapid reversal of muscle relaxation after the use of rocuronium or vecuronium. The lowest recommended dose is 2 mg kg−1 intravenously when there are two twitches during the train-of-four stimulation. OBJECTIVE To study the efficacy and risks of a lower dose of sugammadex administered earlier. DESIGN Monocentric randomised controlled double-blind study. SETTING Academic hospital. PATIENTS Eighty patients were enrolled and randomised in 8 groups of 10 patients, 56 were finally evaluated. INTERVENTIONS Patients were distributed in two clusters constituting four groups each. In the first cluster, injections were administered after the return of one twitch with the train-of-four (TOF1). In the second cluster, injections were delivered after the return of two twitches with the TOF (TOF2). We created four groups in each cluster for different dosages: placebo, 0.5, 1 or 2 mg kg−1. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Time between the injection of sugammadex and full recovery (TOF ratio > 0.9) that is expressed in minutes. RESULTS Fifty-six successive patients were assessed between February and August 2018. The difference to TOF greater than 0.9 was not statistically significant between groups with the same dose administered at different times (F value = 0.001, P value = 0.975). There was a significant difference between groups with a different dosage administered at the same time (F ratio = 28.34; P value <0.0001). Concerning the time to TOF greater than 0.9 from the time point of TOF1, the timing of the dosages were statistically significant using log rank test (P < 0.0001). No patient presented a reparalysis. CONCLUSION No difference between injecting sugammadex at TOF1 or TOF2 was found regarding time to full recovery. Difference regarding sugammadex quantity was found and compatible with other studies.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In intermediate-to-high-risk patients, major abdominal surgery is associated with a high incidence of postoperative complications, mainly pulmonary. Neuromuscular blocking drugs have been suggested as a contributing factor, but this remains unproven. OBJECTIVE: To define the relationship of neuromuscular blockade management (reversal) with postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs). DESIGN: The individualised PeRioperative Open-lung approach Versus standard protectivE ventilation in abdominal surgery study was a prospective, multicentre, four-arm, randomised controlled trial. This is a secondary analysis of the data. SETTING: Twenty-one teaching hospitals in Spain. The study was conducted between 2 January 2015, and 18 May 2016. PATIENTS: Age more than 18 years with an intermediate-to-high risk for PPCs, scheduled for major abdominal surgery lasting more than 2 h. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy or breastfeeding, and moderate-to-severe organ diseases. INTERVENTIONS: The mode of reversal of neuromuscular blockade determined two patient groups: pharmacological reversal versus spontaneous recovery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was a composite of PPCs during the first 30 postoperative days. The association between categorical variables and PPCs within 30 days was studied. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression modelling and propensity score analyses were performed. RESULTS: From the 923 patients included, 596 (64.6{\%}) presented with PPCs within 30 days after surgery. Patients who developed these complications were older with a higher BMI, a lower pre-operative SpO2, a higher ASA physical status score and a higher incidence of arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Pharmacological neuromuscular blockade reversal was associated with a lower incidence of PPCs (odds ratio 0.62, 95{\%} CI 0.47 to 0.82). CONCLUSION: Spontaneous recovery of neuromuscular blockade was an independent risk factor for PPCs in patients with intermediate-to-high risk, undergoing abdominal surgery. We suggest this factor should be included in future studies on PPCs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02158923.},

@article{Kara2014,
	abstract = {Background and objectives: Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may cause postoperative residual curarization when they are used for reversal of neuromuscular blockade. Sugammadex reverses neuromuscular blockade by chemical encapsulation and is not associated with the side effects that may occur with the use of anticholinesterase agents. Because of increased outpatient surgical procedures postoperative residual curarization and rapid postoperative recovery have a greater importance in the pediatric patient population. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of sugammadex and neostigmine on reversing neuromuscular blockade in pediatric patients undergoing outpatient surgical procedures. Methods: 80 patients, aged 2-12 years, scheduled for outpatient surgery were enrolled in this randomized prospective study. Neuromuscular blockade was achieved with 0.6mgkg(-1) rocuronium and monitorized with train-of-four. Group RN (n=40) received 0.03mgkg(-1) neostigmine, Group RS (n=40) received 2mgkg(-1) sugammadex for reversal of rocuronium. Extubation time (time from the reversal of neuromuscular blockade to extubation), train-of-four ratio during this time, time to reach train-of-four>0.9, and probable complications were recorded. Results: There was no significant difference between the patients' characteristics. Extubation time and time to reach train-of-four>0.9 were significantly higher in Group RN (p=0.001, p=0.002). Train-of-four at the time of neostigmine/sugammadex injection in Group RN were significantly higher than in the RS group (p=0.020). Extubation train-of-four ratio was significantly lower in Group RN (p=0.002). Conclusion: Sugammadex provides safer extubation with a shorter recovery time than neostigmine in pediatric patients undergoing outpatient surgical procedures.},

	abstract = {Background: Sugammadex is used for the rapid reversal of neuro muscular block. It was used on an unrestricted basis in our facility prior to July 2014 but has subsequently been restricted due to the removal of cost subsidies. Our aim is to determine the impact of restricting the use of Sugammadex on clinical outcomes. Methods: A retrospective audit was conducted for the period January 1st to December 31st 2014. Sugammadex use was unrestricted during the first 6 months of this period and restricted over the following period. Patients who had endotracheal intubation for any surgery were included in the audit. Non- intubated patients, patients with incomplete data and patients who were intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit were excluded. The Operating Room Information System and medical records were used to obtain information on the operating theatre time, post-anesthesia care unit time and side effects such as postoperative nausea and vomiting, oxygen-de-saturation during recovery and anaphylaxis; Sugammadex usage and cost data obtained from the hospital pharmacy. Results: 1347 and 1302 patients were included for the unrestricted and restricted periods, respectively. There were no significant differences between the time periods with respect to patient characteristics (Age, ASA) or side effects (oxygen de-saturation, nausea). While mean time in theatre was similar across the time periods, mean recovery time was significantly longer during the restricted period (P < 0.0001). One case of anaphylaxis was reported during the restricted period while no cases occurred during the unrestricted period. Median Sugammadex dose was 200 mg and its usage dropped by 54{\%} in the restricted time. The cost of sugammadex was {\$}180 AUD and Neostigmine {\$}1.80 AUD. Conclusions: Though unrestricting Sugammadex reduced recovery time but has had minimal impact on other clinical outcomes. Neostigmine represents a cheaper alternative and its use remains standard practice in our facility.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) barrier serves to prevent regurgitation of gastric contents. Although general anaesthesia depresses its function, its recovery process during emergence from anaesthesia has not been systematically examined. OBJECTIVE: To explore whether recovery of lower oesophageal barrier function differed between patients receiving a mixture of 1 mg atropine and 2 mg neostigmine and those receiving 2 mg kg-1 sugammadex during emergence from anaesthesia. DESIGN: An unblinded randomised controlled pilot study. SETTING: A single university hospital from January 2016 to December 2018. PATIENTS: A total of 20 non-obese adult females undergoing minor surgery. INTERVENTION: The patients were randomly assigned to a group either receiving atropine and neostigmine or sugammadex for reversal of rocuronium. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Through use of the high-resolution manometry technique, the lower oesophageal barrier pressure (PBAR: primary variable) defined as a pressure difference between pressures at the LOS and the stomach was measured at five distinguishable time points during emergence from total intravenous anaesthesia. A mixed effects model for repeated measures was used to test the hypothesis. RESULTS: In all patients baseline PBAR values were positive even under muscle paralysis and general anaesthesia before administration of reversal agents, and did not differ between the groups (P = 0.299). During recovery from muscle paralysis and general anaesthesia, PBAR (mean $\pm$SD) significantly increased (P = 0.004) from 17.0 $\pm$2.9 to 21.0 $\pm$5.0 mmHg in the atropine and neostigmine group (n = 8) and from 19.1 $\pm$9.0 to 24.5 $\pm$12.7 mmHg in the sugammadex group (n = 11). PBAR significantly increased immediately after return of consciousness in both groups, whereas return of muscle tone, lightening of anaesthesia and tracheal extubation did not change it. CONCLUSION: Recovery of the lower oesophageal barrier function does not differ between patients receiving either atropine and neostigmine or sugammadex and is completed after recovery of consciousness from general anaesthesia.

	abstract = {Background: Morbid obese (MO) population is increasing every year worldwide, and laparoscopic bariatric surgery (LBS) has a central role in their treatment. The postoperative period of MO is not free from complications. The introduction of sugammadex has brought huge developments in patient's safety and nowadays LBS is performed with better care and quality. However, the effect of this agent in postoperative pain is still unknown. Materials and methods: A controlled trial enrolling 88 MO submitted to LBS under general anesthesia using muscle relaxation, randomly assigned into 2 groups: one received sugammadex (SUG group) at the end of surgery and the other neostigmine (NEO group). In the postanesthetic care unit (PACU), we evaluated pain using the visual analogue scale in 4 different moments: arrival in the PACU, 30 minutes after arrival, 60 minutes after arrival, and immediately before leaving the PACU. We also recorded the presence of postoperative nausea and vomits (PONV) and the duration of the PACU stay before discharge to the ward. Results: Forty-four patients received sugammadex and 44 received neostigmine. We found lower visual analogue scale pain scores in the SUG group at 30 and 60 minutes after arriving to the PACU (P<0.05). We also had less PONV in the SUG group and these patients were also discharged earlier. Conclusions: Sugammadex is associated with less pain felt in the PACU. This "opioid-sparing" effect, combined with less PONV and a faster discharge from the PACU, makes sugammadex an indispensable drug in this type of patients and allows fast-track surgery in the MO.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Background And Objective: Sugammadex reverses neuromuscular blockade induced by aminosteroid agents by encapsulating these agents. This study designed to assess safety and efficacy of sugammadex in reversing rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade. Patients And Methods: One hundred ASA 1-2 patients aged 20 - 40 years scheduled for short elective surgery were allocated and divided into 5 equal groups (A, B, C, D and E). Rocuronium administered in a dosage of 0.6 mg / kg for patients of groups A, B, C and D, and administered in a dose of 1.2 mg/kg for the 5th group (E). After surgery, neostigmine 50 mic/kg with atropine 0.015 mg/kg was administered on train-of-four (TOF) 0.2 for group A patients while sugammadex was administered in a dosage of 3 mg / kg on (TOF) 0.2 for group B patients. patients of group C and D received sugammadex on TOF 0.0 with PTC stimulation recorded in a dose of 3 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg respectively. While the patients of the group E received sugammadex in a dose of 1.2 mg/kg on TOF 0.0 with PTC stimulation recorded. Times until recovery of T4/T1 ratios 0.9 were recorded. Results: Time between sugammadex administration until recovery of a TOF ratio of 0.9 was shorter for patients of group B than group A (mean {$[$}SD{$]$}, 78. {$[$}16.75{$]$} seconds and 213.1 {$[$}48.8{$]$} seconds, respectively), which is highly significant. While patients of group C and D times were (126.8 {$[$}26.8{$]$} seconds and 84.78 {$[$}17.05{$]$} seconds respectively), also highly significant. patients of group E, time was 70.5{$[$}8.56{$]$}. No signs of recurarization, residual paralysis or associated serious adverse effects were observed for all patients. Conclusion: Sugammadex effectively and safely reverses a rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade significantly faster than neostigmine and in a reverse pattern (increasing the dose decreasing the time).},
