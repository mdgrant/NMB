	abstract = {Residual neuromuscular blockade can be evaluated using acceleromyography, tactile assessment of train-of-four (TOF), double-burst stimulation (DBS), 50-Hz tetanus, or 100-Hz tetanus. Nerve stimulation can be at the hand or the wrist. We compared all these tests at both sites of stimulation. Rocuronium was given to 32 patients under sevoflurane anesthesia. The mechanomyographic adductor pollicis TOF ratio was measured at one extremity. In the other, stimulation was at the hand or the wrist, by random allocation, and the acceleromyographic TOF ratio was measured. During recovery, a blinded observer estimated tactile fade. The TOF fade became undetectable when mechanomyographic TOF ratio was (mean +/- sd) 0.31 +/- 0.15. For DBS, this threshold was 0.76 +/- 0.11. For 50-Hz tetanus, it was 0.31 +/- 0.15. For 100-Hz tetanus, it was 0.88 +/- 0.18, with a range of 0.14-1.00. These tactile responses were the same for hand and wrist stimulation. When acceleromyographic TOF ratio reached 1.0, the mechanomyographic TOF ratio was 0.89 +/- 0.06. With stimulation in the hand, acceleromyographic TOF ratio >1.0 was less frequent than at the wrist. To exclude residual paralysis, TOF, DBS, and 50-Hz tetanus are inadequate, 100-Hz tetanus is unreliable, and acceleromyography performs best.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many studies have indicated that acceleromyography and mechanomyography cannot be used interchangeably. To improve the agreement between the two methods, it has been suggested to use a preload and to refer all train-of-four (TOF) ratios to the control TOF (normalization) when using acceleromyography. The first purpose of this study was to test whether a preload applied to acceleromyography would increase the precision and the agreement with mechanomyography. The second purpose was to evaluate whether normalization would improve the agreement with mechanomyography. METHODS: Sixty patients were randomized to acceleromyography with or without a preload (Hand Adapter; Organon, Oss, the Netherlands). On the contralateral arm, mechanomyography was used. Anesthesia was induced with propofol and an opioid, and neuromuscular block with 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium. The precision and the bias and limits of agreement (with or without normalization) between the methods were evaluated using TOF stimulation. RESULTS: Preload improved the precision of acceleromyography by 21{\%}, but it also increased the mean control TOF ratio from 1.07 to 1.13. Normalization of the acceleromyographic TOF ratios diminished the bias to mechanomyography during recovery (e.g., from 0.15 to 0.05 at TOF 0.90); when the mechanomyographic TOF values were normalized as well, the bias was eliminated. However, normalization did not exclude wide individual differences between acceleromyography and mechanomyography (+/- 0.10-0.20 at TOF 0.90). CONCLUSION: Preload increases the precision of acceleromyography, and normalization of the TOF ratios decreases bias in relation to mechanomyography. When both acceleromyography and mechanomyography are normalized, there is no significant bias between the two methods.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Quantitative neuromuscular monitoring is now widely recommended during anesthesia using neuromuscular blocking agents to prevent postoperative residual paralysis and its related complications. We compared the TOF-Watch SX accelerometer requiring initial calibration to the TOF-Scan, a new accelerometer with a preset stimulation intensity of 50mA not necessitating calibration. STUDY DESIGN: This pilot, prospective, observational study included adults undergoing general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation and muscle relaxation, having both arms free during surgery. Accelerometers were set up randomly on each arm. Anesthesia was started with remifentanil and propofol before an intubation dose of atracurium or rocuronium. Train of four stimulation was performed every 15s. Differences between measures were tested using Student's t-test and agreement assessed by Bland and Altman analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were included. During onset, a mean bias of -26seconds with a limit of agreement from -172 to +119seconds was observed between TOF-Watch SX and TOF-Scan to obtain 0 response to TOF. During recovery, TOF-Scan showed a significantly later recovery from 1 response to T4/T1>10{\%}, but a bias of 0minute and limits of agreement from -4 to +4minutes for T4/T1>90{\%} (NS). CONCLUSION: These results suggest a poor agreement between the calibrated TOF-Watch SX and the fix intensity TOF-Scan for onset and early recovery of relaxation (i.e. deep neuromuscular blockade) but a good agreement for recovery to TOF 90{\%}. Data are not interchangeable between the devices, but both can be useful to detect residual paralysis.},

@article{Dahaba2002,
	abstract = {UNLABELLED: The neuromuscular transmission module (M-NMT) is an integrated piezoelectric motion sensor module incorporated in the AS/3(TM) anesthesia monitor. We compared the neuromuscular block of 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium (twice the 95{\%} effective dose) monitored by the M-NMT with that monitored by the Relaxometer mechanomyograph (MMG). The two monitors were alternately allocated to the left or right hands of 20 patients. T(1){\%}, the first twitch of the train-of-four (TOF), and the TOF ratio (T(4)/T(1)) were used for evaluating the neuromuscular block. There was no significant difference in the mean (min) plus minus SD onset time or time to 0.8 TOF ratio recovery measured by the M-NMT (1.5 plus/minus 0.3, 49.4 plus/minus 8.1) compared with MMG (1.8 plus/minus 0.6, 50.9 plus/minus 9.9), respectively. However, the time (min) to 25{\%} T(1) recovery was significantly longer when monitored by the M-NMT (25.6 plus/minus 8) than by the MMG (20.2 plus/minus 6.3). During recovery from neuromuscular block, the difference between the TOF ratios measured by the two monitors showed a bias of -0.031, and the limits of agreement (bias plus/minus 1.96 SD) were -0.281 and +0.22. The M-NMT monitor could determine the time to tracheal intubation as well as full recovery from neuromuscular block, but it lagged behind the MMG in determining the time to rocuronium repeat dose administration. IMPLICATIONS: Compared with the Relaxometer mechanomyograph, the neuromuscular transmission module could equally indicate time to tracheal intubation and full recovery from 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium neuromuscular block. Its small quick-fit sensor has the advantage, in an often crowded and busy operating room, of being incorporated in the AS/3(TM) anesthesia workstation.},

	abstract = {Aim of the work To compare KMG versus EMG neuromuscular monitoring in pediatric patients receiving cisatracurium during general anesthesia. Methods After approval of the protocol by Ethics Committee 24 pediatric patients of both sexes aged 2-6 years, with a maximum weight 20 kg, were included in the study. Monitoring equipments (Datex-Ohmeda A/S 5{\texttrademark}) were attached to the patient. The electromyogram was attached to one hand, while, KMG was attached to the other hand for simultaneous monitoring. Induction of anesthesia with fentanyl 2 μg/kg and propofol 2 mg/kg followed by endotracheal intubation. Anesthesia was maintained by end-tidal isoflurane 1.2{\%}. Ventilation was kept by 50{\%} oxygen in air and was adjusted to maintain end-tidal CO2 in the range of 35-40 mm Hg. After a stable baseline period of at least 3 min, the 24 patients were received 0.1 mg/kg cisatracurium twice the 95{\%} effective dose (2 ×ED95). The following parameters were collected and compared; (1) lag time (time from start of muscle relaxant administration until the first measurable neuromuscular block (NMB), (2) onset time (time from start of muscle relaxant administration until maximal NMB), (3) assessing the recovery period by; train of four (TOF) 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 0.90 (time to reach a TOF ratio of 25{\%}, 50{\%}, 75{\%} and 90{\%}, respectively). No top-up doses of muscle relaxants were given. Results There was no statistical difference between both studied groups as regard the demographic data of the patients, the lag time, the onset time, TOF 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 0.9 ratios using either EMG or KMG. In addition, there is excellent degree of agreement between EMG and KMG in measuring TOF ratio during both induction and recovery of muscle relaxants. Conclusions KMG showed an excellent degree of agreement with EMG for determination of onset and recovery of NMB in children. {\copyright}2013 Egyptian Society of Anesthesiologists.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare TOF-Cuff (TOF-C) and TOF-Watch (TOF-W) data following rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block and its reversal with sugammadex. METHODS: Twenty elderly patients aged 68-82 years scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia were enrolled in this study. After induction of anesthesia, neuromuscular block resulting from administration of 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium was concurrently evaluated using TOF-C and TOF-W. The onset of neuromuscular block and duration until the first twitch response following post-tetanic count (PTC) and 2 Hz train-of-four (TOF) stimulation reappeared were evaluated. When the response to the TOF stimulus was detected with both monitors, additional doses of rocuronium were administered to maintain the neuromuscular block. After surgery, 2 mg/kg sugammadex was administered when 1-2 TOF twitches were observed with the TOF-W and the time required for facilitated recovery to a TOF ratio of > 0.9 was assessed. RESULTS: Regression analyses revealed no statistically significant differences in the mean {$[$}SD{$]$} onset of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block {$[$}127.8 (27.2) s, 123.5 (30.5) s{$]$}, time to recovery of the first PTC twitch {$[$}23.9 (8.0) min, 25.4 (8.6) min{$]$}, time to recovery of the first twitch with TOF stimulation {$[$}37.2 (8.8) min, 38.9 (11.1) min{$]$} and time to adequate reversal with sugammadex {$[$}139.2 (30.6) s, 151.8 (31.5) s{$]$} between TOF-C and TOF-W, respectively. Bland-Altman analyses also showed acceptable ranges of the biases and limits of agreement between the two methods. CONCLUSIONS: TOF-C may be clinically applicable for the evaluation of both the depth of neuromuscular block and restoration of neuromuscular function.},

@article{Khandkar2016,
	abstract = {This study compared two commercially available quantitative neuromuscular function monitoring techniques, kinemyography (KMG) and electromyography (EMG), to assess whether KMG could be used interchangeably with EMG to exclude residual neuromuscular blockade (RNMB). Train-of-four (TOF) ratios were recorded every 20 seconds using KMG at the adductor pollicis and EMG at the first dorsal interosseous of the same hand during spontaneous recovery from shallow neuromuscular blockade. TOF ratios were compared using Bland-Altman analysis for repeated measurements. The precision of each device was assessed by the repeatability coefficient. Agreement between devices was assessed by the bias and limits of agreement. Clinically acceptable agreement was defined as a bias <0.025 within limits of agreement +/-0.05. We recorded 629 sets of TOF ratios from 23 patients. The repeatability coefficient for KMG was 0.05 (95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$} 0.05 to 0.06) and for EMG 0.10 (95{\%} CI 0.10 to 0.11). Overall, the bias of KMG TOF ratios against EMG TOF ratios was 0.11 (95{\%} CI 0.10 to 0.12), with limits of agreement -0.11 to 0.32. In the 0.80 to 0.99 TOF range, the bias was 0.08 (95{\%} CI 0.06 to 0.09) and the limits of agreement were -0.12 to 0.27. Overall, TOF ratios measured by KMG were on average 0.11 higher than EMG. In the 0.80 to 0.99 TOF range, KMG TOF ratios were 0.08 higher. EMG and KMG are not interchangeable because the bias is large and the limits of agreement are wide. Thus a maximum TOF ratio of 1.0 on KMG may not exclude RNMB.},

@article{Liang2013,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Residual neuromuscular block is defined as a mechanomyography (MMG) or electromyography (EMG) train-of-four (TOF) ratio <0.90, and is common in patients receiving neuromuscular blocking drugs. Objective neuromuscular monitoring is the only reliable way to detect and exclude residual neuromuscular block. Acceleromyography (AMG) is commercially available and easy to use in the clinical setting. However, AMG is not interchangeable with MMG or EMG. Currently, it is unclear what value must be reached by AMG TOF ratio to reliably exclude residual neuromuscular block. METHODS: During spontaneous recovery from neuromuscular block, we monitored TOF ratio on the same arm using AMG at the adductor pollicis and EMG at the first dorsal interosseus. AMG and EMG TOF ratios were compared by the Bland-Altman analysis for repeated measurements. The precision of each device was assessed by the repeatability coefficient. A small repeatability coefficient indicates high precision of the device. The agreement between the devices was assessed by the bias and the 95{\%} limits of agreement. Small bias and narrow limits of agreement indicate strong agreement. We defined clinically acceptable agreement between AMG and EMG as a bias <0.025 and limits of agreement within -0.050 to 0.050, provided that the control comparison between EMG and itself can fulfill these criteria. RESULTS: In 26 patients, 261 comparisons between AMG and EMG were made. The repeatability coefficient of AMG and EMG were 0.094 (95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$}, 0.088-0.100) and 0.051 (95{\%} CI, 0.048-0.055), respectively. The bias between AMG and EMG TOF ratio was 0.176 (95{\%} CI, 0.162-0.190), with limits of agreement -0.045 to 0.396 (95{\%} CI, -0.067 to 0.419). CONCLUSIONS: AMG is less precise than EMG and overestimates EMG TOF ratio by at least 0.15. The lack of agreement cannot be attributed to instrumental imprecision or the baseline difference between successive measurements during spontaneous recovery of neuromuscular function. Residual neuromuscular block cannot be excluded on reaching an AMG TOF ratio of 1.00.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anesthesia guidelines advise objective neuromuscular monitoring. Acceleromyography, the standard technique used in clinical practice, is commonly used with the train-of-four (TOF) nerve stimulation pattern. Objective of this study was to compare the performance of two devices, TOF-Scan(R) and TOF-Cuff(R). METHODS: This prospective, controlled observational study included patients undergoing surgery in general anesthesia with the need of neuromuscular blockade. Both neuromuscular monitoring devices were simultaneously placed on individual patients. Atracurium (0.5 mg/kg) was administered once. Main outcome measure was return time to TOF ratio >/=90{\%}, secondary outcomes were time to TOF-ratio of 0{\%} (during induction) and time to recovery to TOF-count of two. Results from the two devices were compared by Bland-Altman plots and one-sample t-test (P<0.05). RESULTS: Mean time to recovery to TOF ratio 90{\%} was 79.6+/-13.6 min for TOF-Scan(R) and 70.8+/-12.8 min for TOF-Cuff(R) (P<0.001; mean bias 8.9 min, 95{\%} CI: 5.8-12.0). Mean time to TOF-ratio 0{\%} was 164.6+/-38.8 s for TOF-Scan(R) and 145.5+/-44.6 s for TOF-Cuff(R) (P<0.001; mean bias 19.1 s, 95{\%} CI: 10.0-28.2). Mean time to recovery to TOF count two was 52.8+/-12.5 min for TOF-Scan(R) and 45.5+/-11.1 min for TOF-Cuff(R) (P<0.001; mean bias 7.3 min, 95{\%} CI: 4.3-10.2). CONCLUSIONS: TOF-Cuff(R) consistently recorded the endpoints earlier than TOF-Scan(R). Despite large intra-individual variations found with both devices, these results could be meaningful in a clinical setting.},

@article{Motamed2021,
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This study was designed to compare the Datex neuromuscular transmission (NMT) kinemyography (NMTK) device with the TOFscan (TS) accelerometer during the onset and recovery of neuromuscular blockade. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective study included adult patients who were scheduled to undergo elective surgery with general anesthesia and orotracheal intubation. The TS accelerometer was randomly placed at the adductor pollicis on one hand, and the NMTK was placed on the opposite arm. Anesthesia was initiated with remifentanil target-controlled infusion (TCI) and 2.0-3.0 mg/kg of propofol. Thereafter, 0.5 mg/kg of atracurium or 0.6 mg/kg of rocuronium was injected. If needed, additional neuromuscular blocking agents were administered to facilitate surgery. First, we recorded the train of four (TOF) response at the onset of neuromuscular blockade to reach a TOF count of 0. Second, we recorded the TOF response at the recovery of neuromuscular blockade to obtain a T4/T1 90{\%} by both TS and NMTK. RESULTS: There were 32 patients, aged 38-83 years, with the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status Classification I-III included and analyzed. Surgery was abdominal, gynecologic, or head and neck. The Bland and Altman analysis for obtaining zero responses during the onset showed a bias (mean) of 2.7 s (delay) of TS in comparison to NMTK, with an upper/lower limit of agreement of {$[$}104; -109 s{$]$} and a bias of 36 s of TS in comparison to NMTK, with an upper/lower limit of agreement of {$[$}-21.8, -23.1 min{$]$} during recovery (T4/T1 > 90{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of the present study, the two devices are not interchangeable. Clinical decisions for deep neuromuscular blockade should be made cautiously, as both devices appear less accurate with significant variability.},

@article{Murphy2018,
	abstract = {WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS TOPIC: WHAT THIS ARTICLE TELLS US THAT IS NEW: BACKGROUND:: Quantitative neuromuscular monitoring is required to ensure neuromuscular function has recovered completely at the time of tracheal extubation. The TOFscan (Drager Technologies, Canada) is a new three-dimensional acceleromyography device that measures movement of the thumb in multiple planes. The aim of this observational investigation was to assess the agreement between nonnormalized and normalized train-of-four values obtained with the TOF-Watch SX (Organon, Ireland) and those obtained with the TOFscan during recovery from neuromuscular blockade. METHODS: Twenty-five patients were administered rocuronium, and spontaneous recovery of neuromuscular blockade was allowed to occur. The TOFscan and TOF-Watch SX devices were applied to opposite arms. A preload was applied to the TOF-Watch SX, and calibration was performed before rocuronium administration. Both devices were activated, and train-of-four values were obtained every 15 s. Modified Bland-Altman analyses were conducted to compare train-of-four ratios measured with the TOFscan to those measured with the TOF-Watch SX (when train-of-four thresholds of 0.2 to 1.0 were achieved). RESULTS: Bias and 95{\%} limits of agreement between the TOF-Watch SX and the TOFscan at nonnormalized train-of-four ratios between 0.2 and 1.0 were 0.021 and -0.100 to 0.141, respectively. When train-of-four measures with the TOF-Watch SX were normalized, bias and 95{\%} limits of agreement between the TOF-Watch SX and the TOFscan at ratios between 0.2 and 1.0 were 0.015 and -0.097 to 0.126, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Good agreement between the TOF-Watch SX with calibration and preload application and the uncalibrated TOFscan was observed throughout all stages of neuromuscular recovery.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: Comparison of the TetraGraph (TG) and TOFscan (TS) for monitoring recovery from neuromuscular blockade in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU). DESIGN: Randomized, multicenter trial. SETTING: PACU in three tertiary care hospitals. PATIENTS: 120 patients (40 per site) receiving neuromuscular blockade during elective surgery. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were enrolled preoperatively and intraoperative neuromuscular blockade management was at the discretion of the anesthesiologist. Upon arrival to the PACU, patients were randomized to have either TG or TS placed on their dominant hand. The alternate device (TS or TG) was placed on the non-dominant hand. Following simultaneous ulnar nerve stimulation on each arm, the response of the adductor pollicis was measured. MEASUREMENTS: Train-of-four ratios (TOFRs) were obtained upon arrival to the PACU (t = 0), after 5 min (t = + 5) and after +10 min (t = + 10). MAIN RESULTS: There was there was no significant difference in the mean TOFRs obtained with the TG and TS at t = 0 (0.97 +/- 0.18 vs 0.94 +/- 0.13, P = 0.06, respectively) and t = + 5 (0.96 +/- 0.20 vs 0.95 +/- 0.12, P = 0.29, respectively). At (t = + 10), there was a statistically significant difference in mean TOFRs obtained with the TG and TS, (0.99 +/- 0.14 vs 0.94 +/- 0.12, P < 0.001, respectively). The bias between devices at t = 0 was estimated to be 0.03 (95{\%} CI, -0.29 to 0.35, P = 0.26); at t = + 5 min, it was estimated to be 0.02 (95{\%} CI, -0.36 to 0.40, P = 0.54); and at t = +10 min, it was estimated to be 0.05 (95{\%} CI, -0.25 to 0.36, P = 0.77). CONCLUSIONS: TS and TG provide interchangeable quantitative measurements once the TOF ratio has returned to a value of 0.90 or greater in the PACU.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: TOF-Cuff((R)) is a modified blood pressure cuff used to monitor neuromuscular block. We compared the assessment of spontaneous neuromuscular recovery between TOF-Cuff((R)) (test device) and TOF Watch SX((R)) (reference device). METHODS: Forty patients aged 18-65 years undergoing elective surgery were enrolled. TOF-Cuff((R)) was installed on an upper arm and the TOF Watch SX((R)) on the thumb of the opposite side. Anaesthesia was induced and maintained with intravenous propofol and sufentanil. After induction, the devices were calibrated and continuous train-of-four (TOF) stimulation was started. A single intravenous dose of rocuronium (0.6 mg kg(-1) ) was administered for intubation. The primary outcome was total recovery time (time in minutes from the injection of rocuronium to a normalized TOF ratio of 90{\%}). Agreement between the two devices was calculated using mean difference and limits of agreement. RESULTS: The primary outcome could be analysed in 27 patients because of 13 exclusions due to neuromuscular block reversal for shorter procedure surgical time, necessity of reinjection of rocuronium or technical failures of one of the two devices. Median total recovery time with the test device was 45 minutes (interquartile range {$[$}IQR{$]$} 38.5-61.5) and 63 minutes (IQR 51.1-74.5) with the reference device. Total recovery time with the test device was on average 16.4 minutes shorter (limits of agreement, -6.1 to 39); increasing total recovery time was associated with increasing difference. The TOF ratio of the reference device was on average 0.59 (SD 0.23) when the test device indicated complete recovery. The TOF ratio of the test device was on average 0.98 (SD 0.03) when the reference device indicated complete recovery. CONCLUSION: When compared with the TOF Watch SX((R)) , TOF-Cuff((R)) overestimates spontaneous recovery of a rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block.},

@article{Stewart2014,
	abstract = {In this study, two commercially available quantitative neuromuscular function monitoring techniques, electromyography (EMG) and kinemyography (KMG), were compared with respect to repeatability and accuracy during late recovery from neuromuscular blockade. Train-of-four (TOF) ratios were recorded in 30 patients using KMG and EMG at the adductor pollicis muscle. Measurements were taken on the same hand using the Datex-Ohmeda NeuroMuscular Transmission monitor (GE Healthcare, Helsinki, Finland). Instrumental precision was evaluated using the coefficient of repeatability, while accuracy was assessed using the bias and limits of agreement. The coefficients of repeatability were similar for both techniques (0.035 for KMG and 0.043 for EMG), indicating a similar level of precision. KMG overestimated the TOF ratios measured with EMG with a bias of 0.11 (95{\%} limits of agreement: -0.13 to 0.35). At a TOF ratio of 0.90 the bias was 0.08 (95{\%} limits of agreement: -0.08 to 0.25). This means that at a TOF ratio of 0.90 measured with KMG will be approximately equivalent to a TOF ratio of 0.80 measured with EMG at the adductor pollicis muscle, but it may indeed be as low as 0.65 or as high as 1.00. Therefore, TOF ratios measured by KMG and EMG cannot be used interchangeably.},

@article{Trager2006,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: The gold standard of neuromuscular monitoring is mechanomyography (MMG). Phonomyography (PMG) and kinemyography (KMG) are new methods of neuromuscular monitoring. In this study, all three methods were compared to determine neuromuscular blockade at the adductor pollicis muscle. METHODS: In 14 patients, phonomyography was recorded via a microphone taped to the thenar region. A standard mechanomyographic device was applied to the same thumb, and attached to the force transducer. On the contralateral side, a NMT-Mechanosensor(R) probe was attached to the thumb and forefinger (KMG). After induction of general anaesthesia, the ulnar nerves were stimulated supramaximally using superficial electrodes at the wrists using train-of-four (TOF) stimulation every 12 sec. Onset and recovery indices measured by the three methods after mivacurium 0.2 mg x kg(-1) iv were compared using ANOVA-multiple group comparisons. Agreement between methods was determined using Lin's concordance correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Onset time and peak effect measured via MMG and PMG were similar. Recovery times from neuromuscular blockade (NMB) as measured via the three methods were not different. Agreement between PMG and MMG was excellent for onset and offset of NMB but unsatisfactory for peak effect. Agreement between MMG and KMG was satisfactory for TOF 0.25 and 0.50, and excellent for TOF 0.75 and 0.90 (onset and peak effect not determined for KMG). Agreement between PMG and KMG was satisfactory for TOF 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75, and excellent for TOF 0.90. CONCLUSION: Mechanomyography, PMG and KMG show satisfactory agreement for determination of recovery of NMB for clinical purposes.},
