	abstract = {The frequency of postoperative residual neuromuscular block following the use of the long-acting non-depolarizing muscle relaxants is high, and manual evaluation of the response to nerve stimulation does not eliminate the problem. In this prospective and randomized study we evaluated the hypothesis that perioperative use of acceleromyography would allow for a more rational and precise administration of the long-acting muscle relaxant pancuronium resulting in a decrease in 1) the incidence and severity of postoperative residual neuromuscular block, 2) the amount of pancuronium used, and 3) the time from end of surgery to tracheal extubation. Forty adult patients were randomized into two groups, one managed without the use of a nerve stimulator, the other monitored using train-of-four (TOF) nerve stimulation and acceleromyography. All patients were anaesthetized with diazepam, fentanyl, thiopentone, nitrous oxide, and in some patients halothane, and they all received pancuronium 0.08-0.1 mg kg-1 for tracheal intubation, and 1-2 mg for maintenance of neuromuscular block. Neostigmine 2.5 mg preceded by atropine 1 mg was administered for reversal. In the patients managed without a nerve stimulator, the trachea was extubated when the anaesthetist judged the neuromuscular function to have recovered adequately for upper airway protection and spontaneous ventilation. In patients monitored with acceleromyography, the trachea was extubated when the TOF ratio was above 0.70. In all 40 patients, TOF ratio was measured using mechanomyography immediately after tracheal extubation and the patients were evaluated for clinical signs of residual neuromuscular block.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	abstract = {The TOF-GUARD is a new device for monitoring the neuromuscular function using acceleration measurement. It is quick and easy to apply and does not require a rigid support for the arm. Forty-one patients were studied to assess the monitoring of vecuronium neuromuscular block (NMB) using accelerography by the TOF-GUARD compared with electromyography by the Relaxograph. Although the mean first twitch (T1{\%}) and mean train-of-four (TOF) ratios measured by the TOF-GUARD corresponded to a certain extent with the Relaxograph, the wide variations of the values for individual patients measured by the TOF-GUARD compared with the Relaxograph and the differences in clinical duration and recovery index between the two monitors do not allow the values of the two monitors to be used interchangeably. The levels at intubation as well as at full recovery of the patients can be assessed equally by the two monitors. Thus, the TOF-GUARD is a reliable clinical monitor in daily anaesthesia practice.},

	abstract = {The neuromuscular transmission module (M-NMT) is an integrated piezoelectric motion sensor module incorporated in the AS/3(TM) anesthesia monitor. We compared the neuromuscular block of 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium (twice the 95{\%} effective dose) monitored by the M-NMT with that monitored by the Relaxometer mechanomyograph (MMG). The two monitors were alternately allocated to the left or right hands of 20 patients. T(1){\%}, the first twitch of the train-of-four (TOF), and the TOF ratio (T(4)/T(1)) were used for evaluating the neuromuscular block. There was no significant difference in the mean (min) plus minus SD onset time or time to 0.8 TOF ratio recovery measured by the M-NMT (1.5 plus/minus 0.3, 49.4 plus/minus 8.1) compared with MMG (1.8 plus/minus 0.6, 50.9 plus/minus 9.9), respectively. However, the time (min) to 25{\%} T(1) recovery was significantly longer when monitored by the M-NMT (25.6 plus/minus 8) than by the MMG (20.2 plus/minus 6.3). During recovery from neuromuscular block, the difference between the TOF ratios measured by the two monitors showed a bias of -0.031, and the limits of agreement (bias plus/minus 1.96 SD) were -0.281 and +0.22. The M-NMT monitor could determine the time to tracheal intubation as well as full recovery from neuromuscular block, but it lagged behind the MMG in determining the time to rocuronium repeat dose administration. IMPLICATIONS: Compared with the Relaxometer mechanomyograph, the neuromuscular transmission module could equally indicate time to tracheal intubation and full recovery from 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium neuromuscular block. Its small quick-fit sensor has the advantage, in an often crowded and busy operating room, of being incorporated in the AS/3(TM) anesthesia workstation.},

However, there are problems associated with this method, such as obtaining stable values, particularly beneath the surgical fields.

	abstract = {Residual neuromuscular blockade can be evaluated using acceleromyography, tactile assessment of train-of-four (TOF), double-burst stimulation (DBS), 50-Hz tetanus, or 100-Hz tetanus. Nerve stimulation can be at the hand or the wrist. We compared all these tests at both sites of stimulation. Rocuronium was given to 32 patients under sevoflurane anesthesia. The mechanomyographic adductor pollicis TOF ratio was measured at one extremity. In the other, stimulation was at the hand or the wrist, by random allocation, and the acceleromyographic TOF ratio was measured. During recovery, a blinded observer estimated tactile fade. The TOF fade became undetectable when mechanomyographic TOF ratio was (mean +/- sd) 0.31 +/- 0.15. For DBS, this threshold was 0.76 +/- 0.11. For 50-Hz tetanus, it was 0.31 +/- 0.15. For 100-Hz tetanus, it was 0.88 +/- 0.18, with a range of 0.14-1.00. These tactile responses were the same for hand and wrist stimulation. When acceleromyographic TOF ratio reached 1.0, the mechanomyographic TOF ratio was 0.89 +/- 0.06. With stimulation in the hand, acceleromyographic TOF ratio >1.0 was less frequent than at the wrist. To exclude residual paralysis, TOF, DBS, and 50-Hz tetanus are inadequate, 100-Hz tetanus is unreliable, and acceleromyography performs best.},

@article{Trager2006,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: The gold standard of neuromuscular monitoring is mechanomyography (MMG). Phonomyography (PMG) and kinemyography (KMG) are new methods of neuromuscular monitoring. In this study, all three methods were compared to determine neuromuscular blockade at the adductor pollicis muscle. METHODS: In 14 patients, phonomyography was recorded via a microphone taped to the thenar region. A standard mechanomyographic device was applied to the same thumb, and attached to the force transducer. On the contralateral side, a NMT-Mechanosensor(R) probe was attached to the thumb and forefinger (KMG). After induction of general anaesthesia, the ulnar nerves were stimulated supramaximally using superficial electrodes at the wrists using train-of-four (TOF) stimulation every 12 sec. Onset and recovery indices measured by the three methods after mivacurium 0.2 mg x kg(-1) iv were compared using ANOVA-multiple group comparisons. Agreement between methods was determined using Lin's concordance correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Onset time and peak effect measured via MMG and PMG were similar. Recovery times from neuromuscular blockade (NMB) as measured via the three methods were not different. Agreement between PMG and MMG was excellent for onset and offset of NMB but unsatisfactory for peak effect. Agreement between MMG and KMG was satisfactory for TOF 0.25 and 0.50, and excellent for TOF 0.75 and 0.90 (onset and peak effect not determined for KMG). Agreement between PMG and KMG was satisfactory for TOF 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75, and excellent for TOF 0.90. CONCLUSION: Mechanomyography, PMG and KMG show satisfactory agreement for determination of recovery of NMB for clinical purposes.},

@article{Liang2013,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Residual neuromuscular block is defined as a mechanomyography (MMG) or electromyography (EMG) train-of-four (TOF) ratio <0.90, and is common in patients receiving neuromuscular blocking drugs. Objective neuromuscular monitoring is the only reliable way to detect and exclude residual neuromuscular block. Acceleromyography (AMG) is commercially available and easy to use in the clinical setting. However, AMG is not interchangeable with MMG or EMG. Currently, it is unclear what value must be reached by AMG TOF ratio to reliably exclude residual neuromuscular block. METHODS: During spontaneous recovery from neuromuscular block, we monitored TOF ratio on the same arm using AMG at the adductor pollicis and EMG at the first dorsal interosseus. AMG and EMG TOF ratios were compared by the Bland-Altman analysis for repeated measurements. The precision of each device was assessed by the repeatability coefficient. A small repeatability coefficient indicates high precision of the device. The agreement between the devices was assessed by the bias and the 95{\%} limits of agreement. Small bias and narrow limits of agreement indicate strong agreement. We defined clinically acceptable agreement between AMG and EMG as a bias <0.025 and limits of agreement within -0.050 to 0.050, provided that the control comparison between EMG and itself can fulfill these criteria. RESULTS: In 26 patients, 261 comparisons between AMG and EMG were made. The repeatability coefficient of AMG and EMG were 0.094 (95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$}, 0.088-0.100) and 0.051 (95{\%} CI, 0.048-0.055), respectively. The bias between AMG and EMG TOF ratio was 0.176 (95{\%} CI, 0.162-0.190), with limits of agreement -0.045 to 0.396 (95{\%} CI, -0.067 to 0.419). CONCLUSIONS: AMG is less precise than EMG and overestimates EMG TOF ratio by at least 0.15. The lack of agreement cannot be attributed to instrumental imprecision or the baseline difference between successive measurements during spontaneous recovery of neuromuscular function. Residual neuromuscular block cannot be excluded on reaching an AMG TOF ratio of 1.00.},

@article{Stewart2014,
	abstract = {In this study, two commercially available quantitative neuromuscular function monitoring techniques, electromyography (EMG) and kinemyography (KMG), were compared with respect to repeatability and accuracy during late recovery from neuromuscular blockade. Train-of-four (TOF) ratios were recorded in 30 patients using KMG and EMG at the adductor pollicis muscle. Measurements were taken on the same hand using the Datex-Ohmeda NeuroMuscular Transmission monitor (GE Healthcare, Helsinki, Finland). Instrumental precision was evaluated using the coefficient of repeatability, while accuracy was assessed using the bias and limits of agreement. The coefficients of repeatability were similar for both techniques (0.035 for KMG and 0.043 for EMG), indicating a similar level of precision. KMG overestimated the TOF ratios measured with EMG with a bias of 0.11 (95{\%} limits of agreement: -0.13 to 0.35). At a TOF ratio of 0.90 the bias was 0.08 (95{\%} limits of agreement: -0.08 to 0.25). This means that at a TOF ratio of 0.90 measured with KMG will be approximately equivalent to a TOF ratio of 0.80 measured with EMG at the adductor pollicis muscle, but it may indeed be as low as 0.65 or as high as 1.00. Therefore, TOF ratios measured by KMG and EMG cannot be used interchangeably.},

@article{Todd2014,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although experts agree on the importance of quantitative neuromuscular blockade monitoring, particularly for managing reversal, such monitoring is not in widespread use. We describe the processes and results of our departmental experience with the introduction of such quantitative monitoring. METHODS: In mid-2010, the senior authors became concerned about the management of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers (NMB) by providers within the department, based on personal observations and on a review of a departmental quality assurance/adverse event database. This review indicated the occurrence of 2 to 4 reintubations/year in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) that were deemed to be probably or possibly related to inadequate reversal. In response, quantitative blockade equipment (Datex-Omeda ElectroSensor{\texttrademark}EMG system) was installed in all our main operating rooms in January 2011. This introduction was accompanied by an extensive educational effort. Adoption of the system was slow; by mid-2011, the quantitative system was being used in <50{\%} of cases involving nondepolarizing relaxants and adverse NMB-related events continued to occur. Therefore, starting in August 2011 and extending over the next 2 years, we performed a series of 5 separate sampling surveys in the PACU in which train-of-four (TOF) ratios were recorded in 409 tracheally extubated adult patients who had received nondepolarizing NMB (almost exclusively rocuronium) as well as in 73 patients who had not received any nondepolarizing NMB. After each survey, the results were presented to the entire department, along with discussions of individual cases, reviews of the recent literature regarding quantitative monitoring and further education regarding the use of the quantitative system. RESULTS: In the initial (August 2011) PACU survey of 96 patients receiving nondepolarizing NMBs, 31{\%} had a TOF ratio of ≤0.9, 17{\%} had a ratio of ≤0.8, and 4 patients (4{\%}) had ratios of ≤0.5. A record review showed that the quantitative monitoring system had been used to monitor reversal in only 51{\%} of these patients, and 23{\%} of patients had no evidence of any monitoring, including qualitative TOF assessment. By December of 2012 (after 2 interim PACU monitoring surveys), a fourth survey showed 15{\%} of 101 monitored patients had a TOF ratio ≤0.9, and only 5{\%} had ratios ≤0.8. (P < 0.05 vs August 2011). Clear documentation of reversal using the quantitative system was present in 83{\%} of cases (P < 0.05 vs August 2011). A final survey in July 2013 showed nearly identical values to those from December 2012. The lowest TOF ratio observed in any patient not receiving a nondepolarizing NMB was 0.92. There were no changes in the patterns of either rocuronium or neostigmine use over the duration of the project (through December 2012), and there have been no cases of NMB-related reintubations in the PACU during the last 2 years. DISCUSSION: Implementation of universal electromyographic-based quantitative neuromuscular blockade monitoring required a sustained process of education along with repeated PACU surveys and feedback to providers. Nevertheless, this effort resulted in a significant reduction in the incidence of incompletely reversed patients in the PACU.},

@article{Colegrave2016,
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Quantitative neuromuscular monitoring is now widely recommended during anesthesia using neuromuscular blocking agents to prevent postoperative residual paralysis and its related complications. We compared the TOF-Watch SX{\texttrademark}accelerometer requiring initial calibration to the TOF-Scan{\texttrademark}, a new accelerometer with a preset stimulation intensity of 50mA not necessitating calibration. STUDY DESIGN: This pilot, prospective, observational study included adults undergoing general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation and muscle relaxation, having both arms free during surgery. Accelerometers were set up randomly on each arm. Anesthesia was started with remifentanil and propofol before an intubation dose of atracurium or rocuronium. Train of four stimulation was performed every 15s. Differences between measures were tested using Student's t-test and agreement assessed by Bland and Altman analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were included. During onset, a mean bias of -26seconds with a limit of agreement from -172 to +119seconds was observed between TOF-Watch SX{\texttrademark}and TOF-Scan{\texttrademark}to obtain 0 response to TOF. During recovery, TOF-Scan{\texttrademark}showed a significantly later recovery from 1 response to T4/T1>10{\%}, but a bias of 0minute and limits of agreement from -4 to +4minutes for T4/T1>90{\%} (NS). CONCLUSION: These results suggest a poor agreement between the calibrated TOF-Watch SX{\texttrademark}and the fix intensity TOF-Scan{\texttrademark}for onset and early recovery of relaxation (i.e. deep neuromuscular blockade) but a good agreement for recovery to TOF 90{\%}. Data are not interchangeable between the devices, but both can be useful to detect residual paralysis.},

	abstract = {This study compared two commercially available quantitative neuromuscular function monitoring techniques, kinemyography (KMG) and electromyography (EMG), to assess whether KMG could be used interchangeably with EMG to exclude residual neuromuscular blockade (RNMB). Train-of-four (TOF) ratios were recorded every 20 seconds using KMG at the adductor pollicis and EMG at the first dorsal interosseous of the same hand during spontaneous recovery from shallow neuromuscular blockade. TOF ratios were compared using Bland-Altman analysis for repeated measurements. The precision of each device was assessed by the repeatability coefficient. Agreement between devices was assessed by the bias and limits of agreement. Clinically acceptable agreement was defined as a bias <0.025 within limits of agreement $\pm$0.05. We recorded 629 sets of TOF ratios from 23 patients. The repeatability coefficient for KMG was 0.05 (95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$} 0.05 to 0.06) and for EMG 0.10 (95{\%} CI 0.10 to 0.11). Overall, the bias of KMG TOF ratios against EMG TOF ratios was 0.11 (95{\%} CI 0.10 to 0.12), with limits of agreement -0.11 to 0.32. In the 0.80 to 0.99 TOF range, the bias was 0.08 (95{\%} CI 0.06 to 0.09) and the limits of agreement were -0.12 to 0.27. Overall, TOF ratios measured by KMG were on average 0.11 higher than EMG. In the 0.80 to 0.99 TOF range, KMG TOF ratios were 0.08 higher. EMG and KMG are not interchangeable because the bias is large and the limits of agreement are wide. Thus a maximum TOF ratio of 1.0 on KMG may not exclude RNMB.},

@article{Unterbuchner2017,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quantitative neuromuscular monitoring is the gold standard to detect postoperative residual curarization (PORC). Many anesthesiologists, however, use insensitive, qualitative neuromuscular monitoring or unreliable, clinical tests. Goal of this multicentre, prospective, double-blinded, assessor controlled study was to develop an algorithm of muscle function tests to identify PORC. METHODS: After extubation a blinded anesthetist performed eight clinical tests in 165 patients. Test results were correlated to calibrated electromyography train-of-four (TOF) ratio and to a postoperatively applied uncalibrated acceleromyography. A classification and regression tree (CART) was calculated developing the algorithm to identify PORC. This was validated against uncalibrated acceleromyography and tactile judgement of TOF fading in separate 100 patients. RESULTS: After eliminating three tests with poor correlation, a model with four tests (r = 0.844) and uncalibrated acceleromyography (r = 0.873) were correlated to electromyographical TOF-values without losing quality of prediction. CART analysis showed that three consecutively performed tests (arm lift, head lift and swallowing or eye opening) can predict electromyographical TOF. Prediction coefficients reveal an advantage of the uncalibrated acceleromyography in terms of specificity to identify the EMG measured train-of-four ratio < 0.7 (100{\%} vs. 42.9{\%}) and <0.9 (89.7{\%} vs. 34.5{\%}) compared to the algorithm. However, due to the high sensitivity of the algorithm (100{\%} vs. 94.4{\%}), the risk to overlook an awake patient with a train-of-four ratio < 0.7 was minimal. Tactile judgement of TOF fading showed poorest sensitivity and specifity at train of four ratio < 0.9 (33.7{\%}, 0{\%}) and <0.7 (18.8{\%}, 16.7{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: Residual neuromuscular blockade can be detected by uncalibrated acceleromyography and if not available by a pathway of four clinical muscle function tests in awake patients. The algorithm has a discriminative power comparable to uncalibrated AMG within TOF-values >0.7 and <0.3.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The overall objective of the study is to determine the ability of TOF-Cuff device (blood-pressure modified cuff, including stimulation electrodes) to monitor with the same device the non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) and the depth of a neuromuscular blockade (NMB) induced pharmacologically, by stimulation of the brachial plexus at the humeral level and recording evoked changes in arterial pressure. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Clinical, single-centre, open-controlled study with 32 adult patients ASA I-III for scheduled elective surgery under general anaesthesia in supine position, for the validation of neuromuscular monitoring, comparing the values obtained from neuromuscular relaxation TOF-Cuff with those obtained by mechanomyography (MMG) (control method) during the recovery phase of NMB, when a TOF ratio>0.7 and>0.9 (primary endpoint) were reached respectively. And an additional consecutive study of 17 patients for validation of NIBP monitoring with TOF-Cuff device vs invasive blood pressure measured by an intra-arterial catheter. All data were analyzed using the Bland-Altman method. RESULTS: Recovery from NMB measured with the TOF-Cuff was earlier compared to MMG. Comparing TOF-ratio>0.9 measured with TOF-Cuff vs TOF-ratio>0.7 with MMG, a specificity of 91{\%} and a positive predictive value of 84{\%} were obtained. In NIBP measurement, the mean error and standard deviation of both systolic blood pressure (1.6$\pm$7mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (-3.4$\pm$6.3) were within the European accuracy requirements for medical devices. CONCLUSIONS: The TOF-Cuff device has been shown to be valid and safe in the monitoring of NMB and in the measurement of NIBP, with no patient presenting any adverse events, skin-level lesions or residual pain. It is not interchangeable with MMG, having a TOF-ratio>0.9 quantified by the TOF-Cuff device, a good correlation with a TOF-ratio>0.7 on MMG.},

@article{Adembesa2018,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence that the incidence of postoperative residual paresis after using neuromuscular blockers ranges from 24 to 50{\%} in post anaesthesia care unit (PACU) and is associated with postoperative complications such as critical respiratory events as evidenced by hypoxia, hypoventilation and upper airway obstruction. Quantitative neuromuscular monitoring (such as the assessment of Train of four (TOF) ratio) and reversal of neuromuscular blockers has been shown to reduce postoperative residual paresis. There are very few outcome studies on effect of residual paresis in PACU. There is a paucity of published randomized controlled trials investigating whether using a TOF ratio ≥0.9 before endotracheal extubation compared to clinical assessment of return of neuromuscular function reduces the incidence of critical respiratory events in PACU. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether using TOF ratio ≥0.9 compared to clinical assessment of return of neuromuscular function before endotracheal extubation reduces the incidence of critical respiratory events in PACU. METHODS: Onehundred sixty eight adult patients in ASA physical status I and II requiring general anaesthesia for elective surgery with cisatracurium as the muscle relaxant were randomized into 2 groups of 84 each. Group 1 were patients who required a TOF ratio of ≥0.9 before extubation. Group 2 patients were extubated based on clinical assessment of return of adequate neuromuscular function by the anaesthetist as is the standard of practice at the Aga Khan University hospital Nairobi. General anaesthesia was standardized in both groups. Both the investigators and patients were blinded during the study.Once the patient was transferred to PACU, oxygen saturation (SP02), respiratory rate and any signs of upper airway obstruction as demonstrated by stridor, laryngospasms or requirement of any airway manipulation was recorded for the first 30 minutes. Duration of anaesthesia and surgery was also recorded. Patient demographics were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference between the 2 groups in terms of patient demographics, duration of surgery and anaesthesia and duration since last muscle relaxant was given. In terms of hypoxia on arrival in PACU, the incidence of mild hypoxia (SPO2 90-93{\%}) was 11{\%} in clinical assessment groupversus 5{\%} in TOF group P-value 0.149 while severe hypoxia (SPO2 <90{\%}) was 19{\%} versus 10{\%} P-value 0.078. During the first 30 minutes in PACU, the incidence of mild hypoxia (SPO2 90-93{\%}) was statistically significant between the 2 groups (12{\%} in clinical assessment group versus 1{\%} in TOF group, P-value 0.005) while severe hypoxia (SPO2 <90{\%}) was 7{\%} versus 5{\%}, P-value 0.373. The incidence of upper airway obstruction was statistically significant between the two groups (45{\%} in clinical assessment group versus 14{\%} in TOF group P-value<0.0001 for patients requiring airway maneuver, 21{\%} versus 2{\%} P-value <0.0001 for those who required tactile stimulation and 31{\%} versus 12{\%} were snoring, P-value 0.003. Logistic regression analysis revealed TOF group was less likely associated with mild hypoxia (OR 0.09 95{\%} CI 0.01-0.71 P-value 0.023), tactile stimulation (OR 0.09 95{\%} CI 0.02-0.40 P-value 0.002), airway maneuver (OR 0.20 95{\%} CI 0.10-0.43 P-value <0.001) and snoring (OR 0.30 95{\%} CI 0.13-0.68 P-value 0.04). CONCLUSION: Among this population, there is a lower incidence of critical respiratory events in PACU with the use of neuromuscular monitoring using TOF ratio ≥0.9 to assess neuromuscular function before endotracheal extubation compared with the use of clinical assessment methods.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In clinical practice, in the majority of patients, recovery from the effect of muscle relaxants is assessed using subjective methods such as head lift, eye-opening, or by sustained hand grip after giving anticholinesterases (neostigmine) at the end of surgery. We planned a prospective observational cohort study to test the hypothesis that objective neuromuscular monitoring can help us in avoiding the use of anticholinesterases for reversal. METHODS: The patients posted for surgery of <2 h duration were included in the study. The cohort of patients was formed on the basis of those who were exposed to objective neuromuscular monitoring of recovery (train-of-four {$[$}TOF{$]$} ratio of 0.9 or more; exposed group) and the patients who were not exposed to objective neuromuscular monitoring (non-exposed group) acting as a control. Using objective neuromuscular monitoring, the time required for recovery from muscle relaxation when neostigmine was not given for reversal was noted and it was then compared with that of the control group. RESULTS: A total of 190 patients were enrolled over a period of 3 years. With the use of TOF ratio of 0.9 for extubation, patients safely recovered from neuromuscular blockade, without using neostigmine, with no difference in the mean recovery time (14.48 $\pm$1.138 min) as compared to the control group (12.14 $\pm$1.067 min, P = 0.139). There was no incidence of reintubation in post-operative period. CONCLUSION: With objective neuromuscular monitoring, we can ensure complete recovery from the neuromuscular blockade while avoiding the use of anticholinesterases.},

	abstract = {WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS TOPIC: WHAT THIS ARTICLE TELLS US THAT IS NEW: BACKGROUND:: Quantitative neuromuscular monitoring is required to ensure neuromuscular function has recovered completely at the time of tracheal extubation. The TOFscan (Drager Technologies, Canada) is a new three-dimensional acceleromyography device that measures movement of the thumb in multiple planes. The aim of this observational investigation was to assess the agreement between nonnormalized and normalized train-of-four values obtained with the TOF-Watch SX (Organon, Ireland) and those obtained with the TOFscan during recovery from neuromuscular blockade. METHODS: Twenty-five patients were administered rocuronium, and spontaneous recovery of neuromuscular blockade was allowed to occur. The TOFscan and TOF-Watch SX devices were applied to opposite arms. A preload was applied to the TOF-Watch SX, and calibration was performed before rocuronium administration. Both devices were activated, and train-of-four values were obtained every 15 s. Modified Bland-Altman analyses were conducted to compare train-of-four ratios measured with the TOFscan to those measured with the TOF-Watch SX (when train-of-four thresholds of 0.2 to 1.0 were achieved). RESULTS: Bias and 95{\%} limits of agreement between the TOF-Watch SX and the TOFscan at nonnormalized train-of-four ratios between 0.2 and 1.0 were 0.021 and -0.100 to 0.141, respectively. When train-of-four measures with the TOF-Watch SX were normalized, bias and 95{\%} limits of agreement between the TOF-Watch SX and the TOFscan at ratios between 0.2 and 1.0 were 0.015 and -0.097 to 0.126, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Good agreement between the TOF-Watch SX with calibration and preload application and the uncalibrated TOFscan was observed throughout all stages of neuromuscular recovery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neuromuscular block using subjective monitoring and neostigmine reversal is commonly associated with postoperative residual neuromuscular block. We tested whether a protocol for the management of neuromuscular block that specified appropriate dosing and optimal neostigmine reversal was associated with a reduction in postoperative residual neuromuscular block. METHODS: Rocuronium administration was guided by surgical requirements and based on the ideal body weight, with dose reductions for female sex and age >55 yr. Neostigmine was administered in adjusted doses after a train-of-four count of four was confirmed at the thumb. The protocol ensured a minimum of 10 min between neostigmine administration and tracheal extubation. We measured the postoperative residual neuromuscular block in patients undergoing abdominal surgery before and after introduction of the protocol. Pre-specified primary and secondary endpoints were incidence of postoperative residual neuromuscular block and severe postoperative residual neuromuscular block at the time of tracheal extubation, defined as normalised train-of-four ratios <0.9 and <0.7, respectively. RESULTS: The incidence of postoperative residual neuromuscular block at tracheal extubation was 14/40 (35{\%}) for patients managed according to the protocol compared with 22/38 (58{\%}) for patients in the control group, odds ratio of 0.39, and 95{\%} confidence interval of 0.14-1.07; P=0.068. The incidence of severe postoperative residual neuromuscular block at tracheal extubation showed a highly significant difference, odds ratio=0.06, and confidence interval of 0.00-0.43; P=0.001. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of severe postoperative residual neuromuscular block was significantly reduced after the protocol was introduced. Given the limitations inherent in this before-and-after study, further research is needed to confirm these results. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02660398.},

@article{Domenech2019,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Complete avoidance of residual neuromuscular blockade (RNMB) during the postoperative period has not yet been achieved in current anesthesia practice. Evidently, compliance with NMB monitoring is persistently low, and the risk of RNMB during the perioperative period remains underestimated. To our knowledge, no publications have reported the incidence of RNMB in a university hospital where access to quantitative NMB monitoring and sugammadex is unlimited and where NMB management is not protocolised. The primary aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of RNMB in patients managed with or without sugammadex or neostigmine as antagonists and quantitative NMB monitoring in the operating room. The secondary aim was to explore the associations between RNMB and potentially related variables. METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort study was conducted at a tertiary referral university hospital in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Records created between June 2015 and December 2015 were reviewed. In total, 240 consecutive patients who had undergone elective surgical procedures requiring NMB were included. All patients were monitored via acceleromyography at the adductor pollicis muscle within 5 min of arrival in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU). Scheduled recovery in the intensive care unit was the only exclusion criterion. RESULTS: RNMB was present in 1.6{\%} patients who received intra-operative quantitative NMB monitoring and 32{\%} patients whose NMB was not monitored (P <  0.01). Multivariable analysis revealed that the use of intra-operative quantitative NMB monitoring and sugammadex were associated with a lower incidence of RNMB, with calculated odds ratios of 0.04 (95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$}: 0.005 to 0.401) and 0.18 (95{\%} CI: 0.046 to 0.727), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study suggest that intra-operative quantitative NMB monitoring and use of sugammadex are associated with a decreased incidence of RNMB in the PACU, reinforcing the contention that the optimal strategy for RNMB avoidance is the use of quantitative NMB monitoring and eventual use of reversal agents, if needed, prior to emergence from anaesthesia.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare TOF-Cuff{\texttrademark}(TOF-C) and TOF-Watch{\texttrademark}(TOF-W) data following rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block and its reversal with sugammadex. METHODS: Twenty elderly patients aged 68-82 years scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia were enrolled in this study. After induction of anesthesia, neuromuscular block resulting from administration of 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium was concurrently evaluated using TOF-C and TOF-W. The onset of neuromuscular block and duration until the first twitch response following post-tetanic count (PTC) and 2 Hz train-of-four (TOF) stimulation reappeared were evaluated. When the response to the TOF stimulus was detected with both monitors, additional doses of rocuronium were administered to maintain the neuromuscular block. After surgery, 2 mg/kg sugammadex was administered when 1-2 TOF twitches were observed with the TOF-W and the time required for facilitated recovery to a TOF ratio of > 0.9 was assessed. RESULTS: Regression analyses revealed no statistically significant differences in the mean {$[$}SD{$]$} onset of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block {$[$}127.8 (27.2) s, 123.5 (30.5) s{$]$}, time to recovery of the first PTC twitch {$[$}23.9 (8.0) min, 25.4 (8.6) min{$]$}, time to recovery of the first twitch with TOF stimulation {$[$}37.2 (8.8) min, 38.9 (11.1) min{$]$} and time to adequate reversal with sugammadex {$[$}139.2 (30.6) s, 151.8 (31.5) s{$]$} between TOF-C and TOF-W, respectively. Bland-Altman analyses also showed acceptable ranges of the biases and limits of agreement between the two methods. CONCLUSIONS: TOF-C may be clinically applicable for the evaluation of both the depth of neuromuscular block and restoration of neuromuscular function.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Less residual paralysis in recovery room was demonstrated when train-of-four (TOF) monitoring was applied. The aim of this study was to know whether optimisation of neostigmine reversal without TOF monitoring was equivalent to reversal using TOF monitoring. METHODS: Seventy two patients, aged 18-60 years, undergoing elective surgery under general anaesthesia (sevoflurane and rocuronium) with intubation were randomised into two interventions: an optimised neostigmine reversal strategy without TOF monitoring (group A, n = 36) and a neostigmine reversal strategy using quantitative TOF monitoring (group B, n = 36). Per-protocol analysis was performed to compare incidence of residual paralysis in the recovery room between the two groups. RESULTS: Six residual paralyses occurred in group A in the recovery room, whereas one case occurred in group B. The equivalence test showed that the 95{\%} confidence interval of this study was outside the range of equivalence margin (15{\%}). The absolute difference was 13.9{\%}: standard error (SE) =0.068 (P = 0.107; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1{\%}, 27.2{\%}). No subjects had TOF ratio <0.70 in the recovery room. The TOF ratio in the recovery room did not differ between the two groups (mean difference: -2.58; P = 0.05; 95{\%} CI: -5.20, 0.29). One respiratory adverse event occurred in this study. CONCLUSION: An optimised reversal strategy without TOF monitoring is not equivalent to a reversal strategy based on quantitative TOF monitoring. TOF monitoring should be used whenever applicable, although neostigmine is optimised.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anesthesia guidelines advise objective neuromuscular monitoring. Acceleromyography, the standard technique used in clinical practice, is commonly used with the train-of-four (TOF) nerve stimulation pattern. Objective of this study was to compare the performance of two devices, TOF-Scan{\textregistered}and TOF-Cuff{\textregistered}. METHODS: This prospective, controlled observational study included patients undergoing surgery in general anesthesia with the need of neuromuscular blockade. Both neuromuscular monitoring devices were simultaneously placed on individual patients. Atracurium (0.5 mg/kg) was administered once. Main outcome measure was return time to TOF ratio ≥90{\%}, secondary outcomes were time to TOF-ratio of 0{\%} (during induction) and time to recovery to TOF-count of two. Results from the two devices were compared by Bland-Altman plots and one-sample t-test (P<0.05). RESULTS: Mean time to recovery to TOF ratio 90{\%} was 79.6$\pm$13.6 min for TOF-Scan{\textregistered}and 70.8$\pm$12.8 min for TOF-Cuff{\textregistered}(P<0.001; mean bias 8.9 min, 95{\%} CI: 5.8-12.0). Mean time to TOF-ratio 0{\%} was 164.6$\pm$38.8 s for TOF-Scan{\textregistered}and 145.5$\pm$44.6 s for TOF-Cuff{\textregistered}(P<0.001; mean bias 19.1 s, 95{\%} CI: 10.0-28.2). Mean time to recovery to TOF count two was 52.8$\pm$12.5 min for TOF-Scan{\textregistered}and 45.5$\pm$11.1 min for TOF-Cuff{\textregistered}(P<0.001; mean bias 7.3 min, 95{\%} CI: 4.3-10.2). CONCLUSIONS: TOF-Cuff{\textregistered}consistently recorded the endpoints earlier than TOF-Scan{\textregistered}. Despite large intra-individual variations found with both devices, these results could be meaningful in a clinical setting.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: TOF-Cuff({\textregistered}) is a modified blood pressure cuff used to monitor neuromuscular block. We compared the assessment of spontaneous neuromuscular recovery between TOF-Cuff({\textregistered}) (test device) and TOF Watch SX({\textregistered}) (reference device). METHODS: Forty patients aged 18-65 years undergoing elective surgery were enrolled. TOF-Cuff({\textregistered}) was installed on an upper arm and the TOF Watch SX({\textregistered}) on the thumb of the opposite side. Anaesthesia was induced and maintained with intravenous propofol and sufentanil. After induction, the devices were calibrated and continuous train-of-four (TOF) stimulation was started. A single intravenous dose of rocuronium (0.6 mg kg(-1) ) was administered for intubation. The primary outcome was total recovery time (time in minutes from the injection of rocuronium to a normalized TOF ratio of 90{\%}). Agreement between the two devices was calculated using mean difference and limits of agreement. RESULTS: The primary outcome could be analysed in 27 patients because of 13 exclusions due to neuromuscular block reversal for shorter procedure surgical time, necessity of reinjection of rocuronium or technical failures of one of the two devices. Median total recovery time with the test device was 45 minutes (interquartile range {$[$}IQR{$]$} 38.5-61.5) and 63 minutes (IQR 51.1-74.5) with the reference device. Total recovery time with the test device was on average 16.4 minutes shorter (limits of agreement, -6.1 to 39); increasing total recovery time was associated with increasing difference. The TOF ratio of the reference device was on average 0.59 (SD 0.23) when the test device indicated complete recovery. The TOF ratio of the test device was on average 0.98 (SD 0.03) when the reference device indicated complete recovery. CONCLUSION: When compared with the TOF Watch SX({\textregistered}) , TOF-Cuff({\textregistered}) overestimates spontaneous recovery of a rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block.},

@article{Motamed2021,
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This study was designed to compare the Datex neuromuscular transmission (NMT) kinemyography (NMTK) device with the TOFscan (TS) accelerometer during the onset and recovery of neuromuscular blockade. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective study included adult patients who were scheduled to undergo elective surgery with general anesthesia and orotracheal intubation. The TS accelerometer was randomly placed at the adductor pollicis on one hand, and the NMTK was placed on the opposite arm. Anesthesia was initiated with remifentanil target-controlled infusion (TCI) and 2.0-3.0 mg/kg of propofol. Thereafter, 0.5 mg/kg of atracurium or 0.6 mg/kg of rocuronium was injected. If needed, additional neuromuscular blocking agents were administered to facilitate surgery. First, we recorded the train of four (TOF) response at the onset of neuromuscular blockade to reach a TOF count of 0. Second, we recorded the TOF response at the recovery of neuromuscular blockade to obtain a T4/T1 90{\%} by both TS and NMTK. RESULTS: There were 32 patients, aged 38-83 years, with the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status Classification I-III included and analyzed. Surgery was abdominal, gynecologic, or head and neck. The Bland and Altman analysis for obtaining zero responses during the onset showed a bias (mean) of 2.7 s (delay) of TS in comparison to NMTK, with an upper/lower limit of agreement of {$[$}104; -109 s{$]$} and a bias of 36 s of TS in comparison to NMTK, with an upper/lower limit of agreement of {$[$}-21.8, -23.1 min{$]$} during recovery (T4/T1 > 90{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of the present study, the two devices are not interchangeable. Clinical decisions for deep neuromuscular blockade should be made cautiously, as both devices appear less accurate with significant variability.},

@article{Renew2021,
	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: Comparison of the TetraGraph (TG) and TOFscan (TS) for monitoring recovery from neuromuscular blockade in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU). DESIGN: Randomized, multicenter trial. SETTING: PACU in three tertiary care hospitals. PATIENTS: 120 patients (40 per site) receiving neuromuscular blockade during elective surgery. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were enrolled preoperatively and intraoperative neuromuscular blockade management was at the discretion of the anesthesiologist. Upon arrival to the PACU, patients were randomized to have either TG or TS placed on their dominant hand. The alternate device (TS or TG) was placed on the non-dominant hand. Following simultaneous ulnar nerve stimulation on each arm, the response of the adductor pollicis was measured. MEASUREMENTS: Train-of-four ratios (TOFRs) were obtained upon arrival to the PACU (t = 0), after 5 min (t = + 5) and after +10 min (t = + 10). MAIN RESULTS: There was there was no significant difference in the mean TOFRs obtained with the TG and TS at t = 0 (0.97 $\pm$0.18 vs 0.94 $\pm$0.13, P = 0.06, respectively) and t = + 5 (0.96 $\pm$0.20 vs 0.95 $\pm$0.12, P = 0.29, respectively). At (t = + 10), there was a statistically significant difference in mean TOFRs obtained with the TG and TS, (0.99 $\pm$0.14 vs 0.94 $\pm$0.12, P < 0.001, respectively). The bias between devices at t = 0 was estimated to be 0.03 (95{\%} CI, -0.29 to 0.35, P = 0.26); at t = + 5 min, it was estimated to be 0.02 (95{\%} CI, -0.36 to 0.40, P = 0.54); and at t = +10 min, it was estimated to be 0.05 (95{\%} CI, -0.25 to 0.36, P = 0.77). CONCLUSIONS: TS and TG provide interchangeable quantitative measurements once the TOF ratio has returned to a value of 0.90 or greater in the PACU.},

	abstract = {Aim of the work To compare KMG versus EMG neuromuscular monitoring in pediatric patients receiving cisatracurium during general anesthesia. Methods After approval of the protocol by Ethics Committee 24 pediatric patients of both sexes aged 2-6 years, with a maximum weight 20 kg, were included in the study. Monitoring equipments (Datex-Ohmeda A/S 5{\texttrademark}) were attached to the patient. The electromyogram was attached to one hand, while, KMG was attached to the other hand for simultaneous monitoring. Induction of anesthesia with fentanyl 2 μg/kg and propofol 2 mg/kg followed by endotracheal intubation. Anesthesia was maintained by end-tidal isoflurane 1.2{\%}. Ventilation was kept by 50{\%} oxygen in air and was adjusted to maintain end-tidal CO2 in the range of 35-40 mm Hg. After a stable baseline period of at least 3 min, the 24 patients were received 0.1 mg/kg cisatracurium twice the 95{\%} effective dose (2 ×ED95). The following parameters were collected and compared; (1) lag time (time from start of muscle relaxant administration until the first measurable neuromuscular block (NMB), (2) onset time (time from start of muscle relaxant administration until maximal NMB), (3) assessing the recovery period by; train of four (TOF) 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 0.90 (time to reach a TOF ratio of 25{\%}, 50{\%}, 75{\%} and 90{\%}, respectively). No top-up doses of muscle relaxants were given. Results There was no statistical difference between both studied groups as regard the demographic data of the patients, the lag time, the onset time, TOF 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 0.9 ratios using either EMG or KMG. In addition, there is excellent degree of agreement between EMG and KMG in measuring TOF ratio during both induction and recovery of muscle relaxants. Conclusions KMG showed an excellent degree of agreement with EMG for determination of onset and recovery of NMB in children. {\copyright}2013 Egyptian Society of Anesthesiologists.
