	abstract = {PURPOSE: Extreme lateral interbody fusion (XLIF) is a method for stabilization of the lumbar spine. Intraoperatively, the surgeon identifies the lumbar nerve roots with a stimulator to prevent their injury. The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which shallow rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block must be intraoperatively reversed for reliable identification of nerve roots. METHODS: General anesthesia (midazolam-propofol-sufentanil-oxygen/air/sevoflurane-rocuronium) was administered to all patients. Train-of-four (TOF) stimulation of the ulnar nerve at 15-s intervals and electromyographic response of the adductor pollicis muscle were used. During operation, the surgeon stimulated the lumbar nerve roots (5-10 mA) to identify their course. At the appearance of two twitches to the TOF stimuli, sugammadex (2 mg/kg) or neostigmine (0.04 mg/kg) was administered. When the response to nerve root stimulation appeared, the TOF ratio was recorded. RESULTS: When the response to nerve root stimulation with 10 mA became detectable, the median (range) TOF ratios were 0.67 (0.50-0.81) and 0.65 (0.42-0.71) after sugammadex and neostigmine, respectively. Similarly, TOF ratios at the first detectable response to stimulation with 5 mA were 0.88 (0.67-0.93) and 0.83 (0.61-0.93). After sugammadex and neostigmine, the respective intervals until TOF ratio ≥0.90 were 2.0 (0.8-3.3) and 15.9 (7.3-28.8) min. CONCLUSION: Intraoperative reversal of shallow rocuronium-induced block with either sugammadex or neostigmine is an efficient method. For reliable detection of lumbar nerve roots with a stimulating current of 10 mA, the block should be reversed to a TOF ratio of at least 0.70. For a current intensity of 5 mA, the TOF ratio should reach 0.90.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Postoperative pulmonary complications may be better reduced by reversal of neuromuscular block with sugammadex than by reversal with neostigmine because the incidence of residual block after sugammadex application is lower and diaphragm function is less impaired than after neostigmine administration. The aim of the study was to compare the effect of reversal of neuromuscular block with sugammadex or neostigmine on lung function after major abdominal surgery. METHODS: One hundred and thirty adults scheduled for major abdominal surgery under combined general and epidural anesthesia were randomly allocated to receive 40 µg of neostigmine or 4 mg·kg(-1) of sugammadex to reverse neuromuscular block. Two blinded researchers performed spirometry and lung ultrasound before the surgery, as well as 1 hr and 24 hr postoperatively. Differences in mean changes from baseline were analyzed with repeated measures analysis of variance. Forced vital capacity (FVC) loss one hour after surgery was the main outcome. Secondary outcomes were differences in rate and size of atelectasis one hour and 24 hr after surgery. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-six patients were included in the main analysis. In the neostigmine group (n = 64), mean (95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}95{\%} CI{$]$}) reduction in FVC after one hour was 0.5 (0.4 to 0.6) L. In the sugammadex group (n = 62), the mean (95{\%} CI) reduction in FVC during the first hour was 0.5 (95{\%} CI, 0.3 to 0.6) L. Thirty-nine percent of patients in the neostigmine group and 29{\%} in the sugammadex group had visible atelectasis. Median {$[$}interquartile range (IQR){$]$} atelectasis area was 9.7 {$[$}4.7-13.1{$]$} cm(2) and 6.8 {$[$}3.6-12.5{$]$} cm(2), respectively. CONCLUSION: We found no differences in pulmonary function in patients reversed with sugammadex or neostigmine in a high-risk population.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to identify the frequency of residual neuromuscular blockade (RNMB) in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) of a tertiary university hospital in Greece, and its correlation with reversal agents. The influence of other perioperative factors was assessed secondarily. METHODS: Patients >18 years old, undergoing surgery with general anesthesia were prospectively studied during a 6-month period. Immediately after arrival at the PACU, the train-of-four ratio (TOF) was assessed by independent investigators, using accelerometry 3 consecutive times, and the mean value was calculated. When TOF was <0.9, RNMB was diagnosed and further interventions were decided. All perioperative data, including history of patients, anesthetic drugs used and surgical details, were recorded from the patients' files. RESULTS: Five hundred twenty patients were studied; 90.4{\%} received rocuronium, 9.2{\%} cis-atracurium, and 0.4{\%} succinylcholine. The prevalence of RNMB was 10.8{\%}. A significant difference (P=0.0006) was detected between patients who received neostigmine versus sugammadex, with the latter showing higher TOF values postoperatively, although the actual incidence of RNMB did not differ between the two groups. Patients with coexisting diseases received sugammadex more frequently (P<0.001), while women, and patients ASA>III were more likely to exhibit RNMB (P=0.02 and P=0.05 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of RNMB was 10.8{\%}. Patients who received sugammadex presented with higher TOF values at the PACU, although no difference in RNMB was detected compared to neostigmine. Female gender and the presence of comorbidities increased the possibility to exhibit RNMB at the PACU.},

	abstract = {ABS TRACT Objective: The aim of the study was to investigate the incidence of postoperative residual curarization (PORC) after rocuronium administration using normalized acceleromyographic (AMG) train-of-four (TOF) ratios. Material and Met hods: During propofol-fentanyl- nitrous oxide anesthesia, neuromuscular block was monitored using acceleromyography method in 130 patients. A TOF ratio measured at the end of control stimulation was recorded as a baseline TOF value. Neuromuscular block was induced with rocuronium 0.6 mg.kg-1 and antagonized with neostigmine 40 μg.kg-1 at the end of anesthesia. Immediately after the patients' arrival in the postanesthetic care unit (PACU), TOF ratios were measured and normalized (i.e., dividing the raw TOF ratio by the baseline TOF value). The incidences of PORC were determined according to three different TOF threshold values: Normalized AMG-TOF ratio <1; raw AMG-TOF ratio <1; and raw AMG-TOF ratio < 0.9. Re sults: The baseline AMG TOF ratios varied widely 110.8 (91-149) among patients. Considering normalized AMG-TOF ratios <1 as PORC, 77 (63.1%) patients had PORC on arrival to the PACU. Significantly fewer patients had raw TOF ratios < 0.9 (39 subjects, 31.9%), and <1 (67 subjects, 54.9%) than whose normalized TOF ratios <1 (77 subjects, 63.1 %) (p< 0.05). Although not statistically significant, the when it was determined using normalized AMG-TOF ratios rather than using raw AMG-TOF ratios (18.3% and 10%, respectively). Conc lu si on: Despite reversal of neuromuscular block with neostigmine, the incidence of PORC is very high after rocuronium administration.},

	abstract = {Deep neuromuscular block aims to improve operative conditions during laparoscopic surgery with a lower intra-abdominal pressure. Studies are conflicting on whether meaningful improvements in quality of recovery occur beyond emergence, and whether lower intra-abdominal pressure is achieved. In this pragmatic randomised trial with 1:1 allocation, adults undergoing elective laparoscopic surgery were allocated to moderate neuromuscular block reversed with neostigmine, or deep neuromuscular block reversed with sugammadex. Allocation was revealed to the anaesthetist only. Primary outcome was cognitive recovery of the Postoperative Quality of Recovery Scale, 7 days after surgery. Secondary outcomes included recovery in other domains of the Postoperative Quality of Recovery Scale at 15 min and 40 min; days 1, 3, 7, 14; and 1 and 3 months after surgery. Chi-square test was used for the primary outcome, and generalised linear mixed model for recovery over time between groups. Of 350 participants randomised, 140 (deep) and 144 (moderate) were analysed for the primary outcome. There was no difference in the Postoperative Quality of Recovery Scale cognitive domain at day 7 (deep 92.9{\%} vs. moderate 91.8{\%}, OR 1.164; 95{\%}CI 0.486-2.788, p = 0.826), or at any other time-point. No significant difference was observed for physiological, emotive, activities of daily living, nociception, or overall recovery. Length of stay in the recovery area (mean (SD) deep 108 (58) vs. moderate 109 (57) min, p = 0.78) and hospital (1.8 (1.9) vs. 2.6 (3.5) days, p = 0.019) was not different. Intra-abdominal pressure and surgical operating conditions were not different between groups. Deep neuromuscular block did not improve quality of recovery compared with moderate neuromuscular block in operative laparoscopic surgery over a 1-h duration.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate whether reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade with sugammadex reduced the incidence of residual blockade and facilitated operating room discharge readiness. METHODS: Adult patients undergoing abdominal surgery received rocuronium, followed by randomized allocation to sugammadex (2 or 4 mg kg(-1)) or usual care (neostigmine/glycopyrrolate, dosing per usual care practice) for reversal of neuromuscular blockade. Timing of reversal agent administration was based on the providers' clinical judgement. Primary endpoint was the presence of residual neuromuscular blockade at PACU admission, defined as a train-of-four (TOF) ratio <0.9, using TOF-Watch{\textregistered}SX. Key secondary endpoint was time between reversal agent administration and operating room discharge-readiness; analysed with analysis of covariance. RESULTS: Of 154 patients randomized, 150 had a TOF value measured at PACU entry. Zero out of 74 sugammadex patients and 33 out of 76 (43.4{\%}) usual care patients had TOF-Watch SX-assessed residual neuromuscular blockade at PACU admission (odds ratio 0.0, 95{\%} CI {$[$}0-0.06{$]$}, P<0.0001). Of these 33 usual care patients, 2 also had clinical evidence of partial paralysis. Time between reversal agent administration and operating room discharge-readiness was shorter for sugammadex vs usual care (14.7 vs. 18.6 min respectively; P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: After abdominal surgery, sugammadex reversal eliminated residual neuromuscular blockade in the PACU, and shortened the time from start of study medication administration to the time the patient was ready for discharge from the operating room.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Monitoring of neuromuscular blockade still often relies on clinical judgement. Moreover, there are substantial national differences in the use of agents to 'reverse' their effects. We investigated the recovery characteristics and incidence of postoperative residual curarization after cisatracurium and rocuronium infusions for long duration interventions without systematic antagonism. METHODS: In 30 patients undergoing major surgery, we measured infusion dose requirements for rocuronium and cisatracurium during propofol anaesthesia. Infusions were discontinued at the beginning of surgical closure; spontaneous recovery of neuromuscular function was awaited in both groups. Neostigmine (50 microg kg(-1)) was administered only when a patient started to wake without a train-of-four ratio (TOF) of 0.9. RESULTS: In the cisatracurium and rocuronium groups, four (27{\%}) and one (7{\%}) patients, respectively, had a TOF ratio > or = 0.9 at the end of surgery. The TOF ratio in each group at that time was 51 +/- 32{\%} for cisatracurium and 47 +/- 31{\%} for rocuronium (P = 0.78). Six patients (40{\%}) in the cisatracurium group and seven (47{\%}) in the rocuronium group required neostigmine. The TOF ratio at the time of reversal was 63 +/- 7{\%} for cisatracurium and 40 +/- 19{\%} for rocuronium (P = 0.01). The time interval between the end of surgery and a TOF ratio of 0.9 was 10 +/- 9 min for cisatracurium and 18 +/- 13 min for rocuronium (P = n.s.). CONCLUSIONS: Patients receiving a cisatracurium or rocuronium infusion have a high incidence of postoperative residual curarization when the block is not antagonized. When 'reversal' is not attempted, cisatracurium seems to be safer than rocuronium.},

The incidence of PORC, defined by a train-of-four (TOF) <90{\%}, was evaluated at post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) arrival in patients whose neuromuscular block had been reversed with neostigmine or sugammadex and those in whom reversal was felt unnecessary (adequate spontaneous recovery). During the PACU stay we recorded the oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) at arrival, episodes of SpO(2) <90{\%}, airway manoeuvres and/or stimulation required to maintain SpO(2) >90{\%}, and the need for re-intubation. In total, 624 patients were studied. Fifteen percent (66/441) of the patients who were not reversed, 15{\%} (21/139) of those who were reversed with neostigmine and 2{\%} (1/44) of those who received sugammadex exhibited PORC (P=0.06). No patient required reintubation in the PACU. The absence of neuromuscular monitoring and pharmacological reversal before extubation were not associated with PORC. A TOF <90{\%} at PACU arrival was not associated with SpO(2) <90{\%} during the PACU stay. Body mass index was the only independent predictor of SpO(2) <90{\%} during the stay in the PACU. These findings indicate that in recent years, the incidence of PORC, defined by a TOF <90{\%}, has dramatically decreased in our institution. The differences in PORC were not statistically significant between patients who received sugammadex for reversal and patients with spontaneous recovery or neostigmine reversal.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This 'real-life' study aimed to analyze the time from the start of neostigmine or sugammadex administration to recovery to a train of four ratio (TOFr) of 0.9 in a real-life in patients receiving rocuronium. The secondary aims were to assess the proportion of patients: presenting TOFr < 0.9 after 5, 10, and 20 min from reversal agent administration, receiving opioids for intraoperative analgesia and extubated in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). METHODS: This was a multisite, prospective, nonrandomized, observational real-life study. Reversal agent was administered at either T2 reappearance or at a post-tetanic count of 1 or 2. Drugs dosages were free according to each investigator's usual practice. RESULTS: Three hundred fifty-nine patients were enrolled onto the study. Time from reversal administration to TOFr to 0.9 is significantly faster in the sugammadex group than in the neostigmine group (shallow block: 2.2 vs. 6.9 min, respectively; P < 0.0001; deep block: 2.7 vs. 16.2 min, respectively; P < 0.0001). The number of patients with TOFr < 0.9 at 5, 10, and 20 min post-reversal agent administration was higher in the neostigmine than in the sugammadex group. Just five patients did not receive opioids. All patients were extubated in the operative room except for a single patient in the sugammadex group who was extubated following PACU admission. CONCLUSIONS: This real-life study confirms that reversal time is faster in patients receiving sugammadex than in those receiving neostigmine. TOFr < 0.9 20 min after reversal was only present in patients treated with neostigmine.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Sugammadex allows for rapid reversal of muscle relaxation after the use of rocuronium or vecuronium. The lowest recommended dose is 2 mg kg−1 intravenously when there are two twitches during the train-of-four stimulation. OBJECTIVE To study the efficacy and risks of a lower dose of sugammadex administered earlier. DESIGN Monocentric randomised controlled double-blind study. SETTING Academic hospital. PATIENTS Eighty patients were enrolled and randomised in 8 groups of 10 patients, 56 were finally evaluated. INTERVENTIONS Patients were distributed in two clusters constituting four groups each. In the first cluster, injections were administered after the return of one twitch with the train-of-four (TOF1). In the second cluster, injections were delivered after the return of two twitches with the TOF (TOF2). We created four groups in each cluster for different dosages: placebo, 0.5, 1 or 2 mg kg−1. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Time between the injection of sugammadex and full recovery (TOF ratio > 0.9) that is expressed in minutes. RESULTS Fifty-six successive patients were assessed between February and August 2018. The difference to TOF greater than 0.9 was not statistically significant between groups with the same dose administered at different times (F value = 0.001, P value = 0.975). There was a significant difference between groups with a different dosage administered at the same time (F ratio = 28.34; P value <0.0001). Concerning the time to TOF greater than 0.9 from the time point of TOF1, the timing of the dosages were statistically significant using log rank test (P < 0.0001). No patient presented a reparalysis. CONCLUSION No difference between injecting sugammadex at TOF1 or TOF2 was found regarding time to full recovery. Difference regarding sugammadex quantity was found and compatible with other studies.

	abstract = {Objectives: To test the hypothesis that the use of a nonmuscle relaxant anesthetic technique (NMRT) during thoracotomy would be associated with comparable surgical conditions with the standard use of neuromuscular blocking drugs.  Design: A prospective, randomized, single-blind, controlled study.  Setting: A single university hospital.  Participants: Sixty-six patients scheduled for open thoracotomy under sevoflurane anesthesia with a target-controlled infusion (TCI) of remifentanil.  Interventions: After ethical approval, patients were randomly assigned to receive cisatracurium or saline (n = 33 for each group) during the entire study period.  Measurements and main results: The four-point ordinal surgical rating scale, the intubating conditions, the use of anesthetics and vasopressors, the incidence of light anesthesia (defined as an episode with state entropy values that exceeded 50 and/or mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate values that exceeded the baseline by 20% and lasted for more than 3 consecutive minutes), and the times to clinical recovery and postanesthesia care unit (PACU) discharge, hospital stays, and postoperative residual curarization (PORC) were recorded. Compared with the use of cisatracurium, the use of NMRT resulted in comparable good-to-excellent surgical rating scales (90.9% v 94.0%, respectively; p = 0.642), good-to-excellent laryngoscopy and endobronchial intubating conditions (93.9% v 100%, respectively; p>0.09), use of anesthetic and vasopressor medications, and hospital stays, together with shorter clinical recovery, extubation times (7.6 [95% CI 6.82 to 8.39] v 19.0 [95% CI 15.76 to 22.23] minutes, respectively; p<0.001), and PACU stays (37.4 [95% CI 35.09 to 39.79] v 70.9 [95% CI 56.90 to 84.91] minutes, respectively; p<0.001). The use of cisatracurium resulted in a nonstatistical number of light anesthesia episodes upon positioning, skin incision, and rib separation (p>0.624, with Fisher's exact test). There were no failed intubations in the 2 groups. No patient received cisatracurium in the NMRT group. Two patients (6.1%) in the cisatracurium group experienced PORC that required tracheal intubation in the PACU.  Conclusion: The use of TCI of remifentanil with NMRT offers acceptable laryngoscopy, intubating, and surgical conditions during sevoflurane anesthesia for open thoracotomy, especially when. the anesthesiologists have more than 10 years' experience.},

@article{Feltracco:2016vz,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade (RNMB) is a common complication in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), but also one of the most controversial issues. Many studies and trials demonstrated that some methods and techniques can reduce the incidence and the extent of the phenomenon. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of RNMB in the PACU at standardized times after extubation with the implementation of a protocol of careful neuromuscular blockade management. DESIGN: Randomized, single-blinded controlled clinical trial. SETTING: Operating room and PACU. PATIENTS: A total of 120 patients of either sex with American Society of Anesthesiologists grades 1, 2, and 3, aged 18 to 80 years were scheduled to undergo elective abdominal surgical procedures lasting for at least 60 minutes. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive either cisatracurium (n=60) or rocuronium (n=60) at the time of intubation and during surgery. Every patient received quantitative neuromuscular monitoring during general anesthesia. On completion of surgery, patients were given neostigmine 0.05 mg kg(-1). Patients were extubated at a train-of-four (TOF) ratio≥0.9. MEASUREMENTS: TOF measurements were performed 15, 30, and 60 minutes after extubation. Tolerability of neuromuscular monitoring was evaluated with a scale from 1 to 10 (with 1 meaning no discomfort at all and 10 meaning maximal discomfort or pain). RESULTS: Six, 11, and 14 patients (5.0{\%}, 9.2{\%}, and 11.7{\%}) exhibited a TOF ratio <0.9 at 15, 30, and 60 minutes after extubation, respectively. No statistically significant difference in the postoperative RNMB between cisatracurium and rocuronium was found. The median tolerability score for neuromuscular monitoring was 3. CONCLUSION: Careful conduction, monitoring, and subsequent reversal of neuromuscular block may allow for obtaining considerably low incidence of residual neuromuscular block. However, our trial shows that some mid- and long-term cases of TOF ratios <0.9 can still occur, possibly jeopardizing the patients' postoperative recovery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sugammadex, a specifically designed gamma-cyclodextrin, is a selective relaxant binding drug that rapidly reverses rocuronium-induced and, to a lesser extent, vecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade. In this study, we compared the efficacy of sugammadex and neostigmine for the reversal of vecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade in patients scheduled for elective surgery. METHODS: Patients aged > or = 18 yr, ASA Class I-III, and scheduled for a surgical procedure under sevoflurane/opioid anesthesia received an intubating dose of vecuronium (0.1 mg/kg) and maintenance doses of 0.02-0.03 mg/kg at reappearance of the second twitch (T(2)) of train-of-four (TOF) if required. Neuromuscular blockade was monitored using acceleromyography (TOF-Watch SX, Schering-Plough Ireland, Dublin, Ireland). At end of surgery, at reappearance of T(2) after the last dose of vecuronium, patients were randomized to receive either sugammadex (2 mg/kg) or neostigmine (50 microg/kg) plus glycopyrrolate (10 microg/kg) i.v.. The primary efficacy end-point was time from start of administration of sugammadex or neostigmine to recovery of TOF ratio to 0.9. RESULTS: The geometric mean time to recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.9 was significantly faster with sugammadex compared with neostigmine (2.7 min {$[$}95{\%} confidence interval {\{}CI{\}}{$]$}: 2.2-3.3) versus 17.9 min {$[$}95{\%} CI: 13.1-24.3{$]$}, respectively; P < 0.0001). The mean recovery times to a TOF ratio of 0.8 and 0.7 were also significantly shorter with sugammadex. No serious adverse events or unexpected side effects were reported with either drug. CONCLUSION: Sugammadex provided significantly faster reversal of vecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade compared with neostigmine.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Because tactile evaluation is the most common form of clinical neuromuscular monitoring, this study examines the relative efficacy of antagonizing residual block at different levels of recovery of the tactile train-of-four (TOF) response. METHODS: Anesthesia was induced in 64 adults with 2-5 microg/kg fentanyl and 1-3 mg/kg propofol and maintained with fentanyl, propofol, and nitrous oxide. The tactile response of the adductor pollicis to TOF stimulation was evaluated at one arm, and the mechanomyographic response was recorded at the other. Patients received 0.15 mg/kg cisatracurium and were randomized to receive 0.07 mg/kg neostigmine on reappearance of the first (group I), second (group II), third (group III), or fourth (group IV) tactile TOF response (16 patients per group). Times from administration of neostigmine until the TOF ratio recovered to 0.7 (R0.7), 0.8 (R0.8), and 0.9 (R0.9) were measured. RESULTS: Data are presented as median with range in parentheses. R0.7 was 10.3 (5.9-23.4), 7.6 (3.2-14.1), 5.0 (2.0-18.4), and 4.1 (2.4-11.0) min in groups I, II, III, and IV, respectively (P < 0.05, group I > II, III, and IV, group II > IV). R0.8 was 16.6 (8.9-30.7), 9.8 (5.3-25.0), 8.3 (3.8-27.1), and 7.5 (3.0-74.5) min in groups I, II, III, and IV, respectively (P < 0.05, group I > II, III, and IV, group II > IV). R0.9 was 22.2 (13.9-44.0), 20.2 (6.5-70.5), 17.1 (8.3-46.2), and 16.5 (6.5-143.3) min in groups I, II, III, and IV, respectively (no intergroup differences). Ten minutes after neostigmine, a TOF ratio of 0.7 or greater was achieved in 50, 75, 88, and 93{\%} of patients in groups I, II, III, and IV, respectively (P < 0.05 group I > II, III, and IV). At 30 min, a TOF ratio of 0.9 or less was observed in 21, 13, 13, and 7{\%} of patients in groups I, II, III, and IV respectively (no intergroup differences). CONCLUSIONS: To achieve rapid (within 10 min) reversal to a TOF ratio of 0.7 in more than 87{\%} of patients, three or four tactile responses should be present at the time of neostigmine administration. It was not possible within 30 min to achieve a TOF ratio of 0.9 in all patients, regardless of the number of tactile responses present at neostigmine administration.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare between deep neuromuscular blockade (NMB) and moderate NMB with respect to endoscopic surgical conditions and recovery profiles in patients with general anesthesia for transurethral resection of bladder (TURB). METHODS: 108 patients undergoing elective TURB were randomized into two groups: the moderate NMB (n = 54) or deep NMB (n = 54) group. After the operation, NMB was reversed with 2 mg/kg sugammadex at a train-of-four (TOF) count of 1 or 2 (moderate NMB group) or with 4 mg/kg sugammadex at post-tetanic count (PTC) of 2 (deep NMB group). Surgeons, who were blinded to the study design, rated the endoscopic surgical condition on a 5-point scale (1 = extremely poor, 2 = poor, 3 = acceptable, 4 = good, 5 = optimal) immediately following the operation. Recovery profiles, including postoperative residual curarization (PORC), respiratory complication, and recovery time, were recorded. RESULTS: No difference was observed between the two groups regarding patients and anesthesia characteristics. There were statistically significant differences in endoscopic surgical conditions between the two groups (P < 0.001). Thirty-eight patients in the deep NMB group (74{\%}) showed optimal surgical conditions, whereas 16 patients in the moderate NMB group (30{\%}) showed optimal endoscopic surgical conditions. No PORC and respiratory complications occurred in both groups, and no difference was found between the two groups in terms of recovery profiles, including recovery time and other adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Deep NMB and reversal with sugammadex improved the endoscopic surgical condition without complications compared with moderate NMB and reversal with sugammadex in patients undergoing TURB.},

@article{Kotake:2013ug,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Japan, routine clinical care does not normally involve the use of a monitoring device to guide the administration of neuromuscular blocking drugs or their antagonists. Although most previous reports demonstrate that sugammadex offers more rapid and reliable antagonism from rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade, this advantage has not been confirmed in clinical settings when no neuromuscular monitoring is used. In this multicenter observational study, we sought to determine whether sugammadex reduces the incidence of postoperative residual weakness compared with neostigmine when the administration of rocuronium and its antagonists is not guided by neuromuscular monitoring. METHODS: This study was conducted in two 5-month periods that preceded and followed the introduction of sugammadex into clinical practice in Japan. Five university-affiliated teaching hospitals participated in this study. Neostigmine was used to antagonize rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade in the first phase, and sugammadex was used in the second phase. The timing and doses of rocuronium, neostigmine, and sugammadex were determined by the attending anesthesiologists without the use of neuromuscular function monitoring devices. To ascertain the incidence of postoperative residual neuromuscular weakness, the train-of-four ratio (TOFR) was determined acceleromyographically after tracheal extubation. Since our practice also does not usually involve calibration and normalization of accelerographic responses, both TOFR <0.9 and TOFR <1.0 were used as the criteria for defining postoperative residual weakness. RESULTS: In the first phase, 109 patients received neostigmine (average dose 33 µg/kg) and 23 patients were considered (by clinical criteria) to have adequate recovery and did not receive neostigmine (spontaneous recovery group). In the second phase, 117 patients received sugammadex (average dose 2.7 mg/kg) for antagonism of rocuronium-induced blockade. The incidence (95{\%} confidence interval) of TOFR <0.9 under spontaneous recovery, after neostigmine, and after sugammadex, was 13.0{\%} (2.8{\%}-33.6{\%}), 23.9{\%} (16.2{\%}-33.0{\%}), and 4.3{\%} (1.7{\%}-9.4{\%}), respectively. The incidence (95{\%} confidence interval) of TOFR <1.0 in these groups was 69.6{\%} (47.1{\%}-86.6{\%}), 67.0{\%} (57.3{\%}-75.7{\%}), and 46.2{\%} (36.9{\%}-55.6{\%}), respectively. The use of sevoflurane in the neostigmine group and the short interval between the administration of the last doses of rocuronium and sugammadex were associated with a higher incidence of postoperative residual weakness. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the risk of TOFR <0.9 after tracheal extubation after sugammadex remains as high as 9.4{\%} in a clinical setting in which neuromuscular monitoring (objective or subjective) was not used. Our finding underscores the importance of neuromuscular monitoring even when sugammadex is used for antagonism of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this prospective audit was to investigate clinical practice related to muscle relaxant reversal and the impact made by the recent introduction of sugammadex on patient outcome at a tertiary teaching hospital. METHODS: Data from all patients intubated at our institution during two epochs of seven consecutive days each was collected prospectively. Directly prior to extubation, the train-of-four (TOF) ratio was assessed quantitatively by an independent observer. Postoperative outcome parameters were complications in the recovery room and radiological diagnosed atelectasis or pneumonia within 30 days. RESULTS: Data from 146 patients were analysed. Three reversal strategies were used: no reversal, neostigmine or sugammadex. The TOF ratio was less than 0.7 in 17 patients (nine no reversal, eight neostigmine) and less than 0.9 in 47 patients (24 no reversal, 19 neostigmine, four sugammadex). Those reversed with sugammadex showed fewer episodes of postoperative oxygen desaturation (15{\%} vs. 33{\%}; P<0.05). TOF ratios of less than 0.7 (P<0.05) and also <0.9 (P<0.01) were more likely associated with X-ray results consistent with postoperative atelectasis or pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a significant impact of residual paralysis on patient outcome. The use of sugammadex resulted in the lowest incidence of residual paralysis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Incomplete recovery of neuromuscular blockade is a common postoperative adverse event in the postanaesthesia care unit. OBJECTIVE: We examined and compared the incidence of residual neuromuscular blockade when the recommended dose of neostigmine or sugammadex was administered according to a qualitative nerve stimulator response. DESIGN: A randomised controlled trial. SETTING: A tertiary care hospital in South Korea from September 2017 to November 2017. PATIENTS: Eighty patients aged between 18 and 69 years were included in this study. All were patients scheduled to undergo elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy and who had an American Society of Anaesthesiologists physical status of one or two were eligible. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were allocated randomly to receive neostigmine or sugammadex at the end of surgery. The doses of the reversal agents were based on the response to peripheral nerve stimulation, which was discontinued after administration of the reversal agent. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade. The secondary outcomes were the incidences of symptoms or signs of residual neuromuscular blockade such as hypoxaemia, inability to maintain head-lift for 5 s and diplopia. RESULTS: The incidence of residual neuromuscular blockade on arrival in the recovery room was 44.4{\%} in the neostigmine group and 0{\%} in the sugammadex group (P < 0.0001, relative risk = 1.80, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.36 to 2.41). The incidences of adverse events in the recovery room were low and comparable between the groups. CONCLUSION: The incidence of residual neuromuscular blockade on arrival in the recovery room was significantly higher in the neostigmine group than that in the sugammadex group. However, the incidence of adverse events was similar in the neostigmine and sugammadex groups. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03292965.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative residual curarization (PORC) is an important complication of neuromuscular blocking drug (NMBD) use. This study evaluates the incidence of PORC in the Postanesthesia Care Unit (PACU), its relation to the type of muscle relaxant and reversal agent used, and its implication in the development of postoperative respiratory complications. METHODS: A prospective observational study of cohorts was made with 558 patients operated under general anesthesia. Data regarding patient history, muscle relaxation (train-of-four {$[$}TOF{$]$}) monitoring, type of relaxants and reversal agents used, and TOF upon admission to the PACU was collected. Four groups were established: cisatracurium, cisatracurium-neostigmine, rocuronium, and rocuronium-sugammadex. An evaluation was made on the incidence of PORC (TOF ratio {$[$}TOFr{$]$} <0.9) in PACU, and its relation to the relaxants and reversal agents used and to the development of postoperative respiratory complications - minor and major (pneumonia, atelectasis). RESULTS: From a total of 558 patients, 27.9{\%} presented with PORC. According to the NMBD used and the administration or not of a reversal agent, the incidence of PORC in the four groups was: cisatracurium 34{\%}, cisatracurium-neostigmine 28.6{\%}, rocuronium 34{\%}, and rocuronium-sugammadex 1.15{\%}. The global incidence of minor critical respiratory events (CREs) was 14.5{\%}: cisatracurium 27.5{\%}, cisatracurium-neostigmine 17.4{\%}, rocuronium 10.5{\%}, and rocuronium-sugammadex 2.3{\%}, with statistically significant differences. The global incidence of major CREs was 7.5{\%}, and was significantly higher in patients with TOFr<0.9 upon admission to the PACU. CONCLUSIONS: PORC in the PACU is associated to a greater incidence of major and minor respiratory complications. The use of rocuronium-sugammadex significantly reduces the incidence of PORC in the PACU.},

@article{Murphy:2020um,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing thoracoscopic procedures may be at high-risk for incomplete neuromuscular recovery and associated complications. The aim of this clinical investigation was to assess the incidence of postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade in adult thoracic surgical patients administered neostigmine or sugammadex when optimal dosing and reversal strategies for these agents were used. The effect of choice of reversal agent on hypoxemic events and signs and symptoms of muscle weakness were also determined. Additionally, operative conditions in each group were graded by surgeons performing the procedures. METHODS: Two hundred patients undergoing thoracoscopic surgical procedures were enrolled in this nonrandomized controlled trial. One hundred consecutive patients maintained at moderate levels of neuromuscular blockade were reversed with neostigmine (neostigmine group) followed by 100 consecutive patients given sugammadex to antagonize deeper levels of neuromuscular blockade (sugammadex group). Anesthetic and neuromuscular management were standardized. Surgeons rated operative conditions at the conclusion of the procedure on a 4-point scale (grade 1 = excellent to grade 4 = poor). Train-of-four ratios were measured immediately before extubation and at PACU admission (primary outcomes). Postoperatively, patients were assessed for adverse respiratory events and 11 signs and 16 symptoms of muscle weakness. RESULTS: The 2 groups were similar in intraoperative management characteristics. The percentage of patients with residual neuromuscular blockade, defined as a normalized train-of-four ratio <0.9, was significantly greater in the neostigmine group than the sugammadex group at both tracheal extubation (80{\%} vs 6{\%}, respectively, P < .0001) and PACU admission (61{\%} vs 1{\%}, respectively, P < .0001). Patients in the neostigmine group had less optimal operative conditions (median score 2 {$[$}good{$]$} versus 1 {$[$}excellent{$]$} in the sugammadex group; P < .0001), and more symptoms of muscle weakness were present in these subjects (median number {$[$}interquartile range{$]$} 4 {$[$}1-8{$]$} vs 1 {$[$}0-2{$]$} in the sugammadex group, P < .0001). No differences between groups in adverse airway events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the application of strategies documented to reduce the risk of residual neuromuscular blockade, a high percentage of thoracoscopic patients whose neuromuscular blockade was reversed with neostigmine were admitted to the PACU with clinical evidence of residual paralysis. In contrast, muscle weakness was rarely observed in patients whose neuromuscular blockade was antagonized with sugammadex.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Electronic neuromuscular monitoring is not widely used to determine either the reversal requirements for neuromuscular block before extubation of the trachea, or to determine if there is any subsequent postoperative residual neuromuscular block (PORNB). OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incidence of PORNB using acceleromyography after spontaneous recovery of rocuronium-induced block and to compare this with the administration of sugammadex, neostigmine or a placebo. DESIGN: Partially randomised, partially randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, four-group parallel-arm study. SETTING: Single-centre study performed between October 2013 and December 2015 in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Of the 134 eligible patients, 128 gave their consent and 125 of these completed the study. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received general anaesthesia with propofol, sevoflurane, fentanyl and rocuronium. Neuromuscular transmission was measured by acceleromyography (TOF-Watch-SX; Organon Teknika B.V., Boxtel, the Netherlands) but the anaesthetist was blind to the results. If the anaesthetist deemed pharmacological reversal to be necessary before extubation of the trachea then patients were assigned randomly to receive either sugammadex (2.0 mg kg), neostigmine (0.05 mg kg) or a placebo. In the postanaesthesia care unit, an independent anaesthetist, unaware of the treatment given, assessed the neuromuscular function using acceleromyography. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The incidence of a normalised train-of-four ratio less than 0.9 on arrival in the recovery room. RESULTS: In total, 125 patients were recruited. Neuromuscular block was allowed to recover spontaneously in 50 patients, whereas the remainder received either sugammadex (27), neostigmine (26) or placebo (22). The number of cases with PORNB were one (3.7{\%}), four (15{\%}), 13 (26{\%}) and 10 (45{\%}) after sugammadex, neostigmine, spontaneous recovery and placebo, respectively.

Sugammadex performed better than spontaneous recovery (OR: 0.11, 95{\%} CI: 0.014 to 0.89, P = 0.039) unlike neostigmine (OR: 0.52, 95{\%} CI: 0.15 to 1.79, P = 0.297). Yet, antagonism (pooled data) was more effective than spontaneous recovery (OR: 0.3, 95{\%} CI: 0.1 to 0.9, P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Although pharmacological reversal based on clinical signs was superior to spontaneous recovery it did not prevent PORNB, irrespective of the reversal agent.

	abstract = {Introduction: In spite of introduction of intermediate-acting neuromuscular blocking drugs (NMBDs), incidence of postoperative residual muscle weakness is still high. The aim of this trial is to study the effect of systemic lidocaine infusion on intraoperative consumption of rocuronium and TOF ratios at extubation and on arrival to postanesthesia care unit (PACU). Methods: Forty-six ASA I-III patients aged 16-60 yr were randomly allocated into two groups: lidocaine (L) group (n = 23) and control (C) group (n = 23). After induction of standard endotracheal general anesthesia with fentanyl, propofol and rocuronium, patients of group L were given i.v. lidocaine bolus (1.5 mg kg-1) followed by continuous infusion (1.5 mg kg-1 h-1) till time of endotracheal extubation while patients in group C were given equal volumes of normal saline. Rocuronium was titrated based on clinical signs. On conclusion of surgery, neostigmine was given to reverse the effects of rocuronium if TOF count was two or more. Immediately before extubation, TOF ratio was measured and recorded and considered the primary outcome. Results: There were no significant differences between the two study groups regarding intraoperative fentanyl doses or core temperature at the end of surgery. End-tidal sevoflurane concentrations were significantly lower in group L than in group P (P < 0.01). The dose of rocuronium was significantly less in group L than in group C (P = 0.001). Train-of four ratios were significantly higher in group L than in group C either before extubation (P < 0.001) or on arrival to PACU (P = 0.001). Conclusion: The current study shows that intraoperative use of i.v. lidocaine infusion in generally anesthetized patients can result in higher TOF ratios at time of extubation and on arrival to PACU when rocuronium was given based on clinical signs. {\copyright}2012 Egyptian Society of Anesthesiologists.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Deep neuromuscular blockade (NMB) may not always be maintained to the end of surgery and the depth of block may be allowed to gradually diminish over time, particularly if reversal of NMB is not routinely performed. AIM: The current study aimed to assess recovery from deep rocuronium-induced NMB with sugammadex compared with placebo, provide data regarding the extent of residual blockade after deep rocuronium-induced NMB (placebo group), and to determine whether complete and reliable recovery could be provided by sugammadex (sugammadex group). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, safety-assessor-blinded study in adult patients of American Society of Anesthesiologists Class I to III. Patients with clinically relevant kidney or liver insufficiency were excluded. Anesthesia was administered as routinely practiced at each study site. Rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg was administered for intubation, with maintenance doses of 0.1-0.2 mg/kg as needed. After the last rocuronium dose, at deep NMB (target depth 1-2 post-tetanic counts), patients received a single dose of sugammadex 4.0 mg/kg or placebo as randomized. The primary endpoint was time from sugammadex or placebo administration to recovery of the train-of-four (TOF) ratio to 0.9. Safety was assessed through monitoring of adverse events, vital signs and physical examination. Patients were also assessed for evidence of residual or recurrence of NMB. With this design, the study will provide data regarding the extent of residual blockade under these conditions (placebo group), and determine whether complete and reliable recovery could be provided by sugammadex (sugammadex group). RESULTS: Recovery to a TOF ratio of ≥0.9 with sugammadex was significantly faster (\~{} 40 times) than spontaneous recovery: geometric mean (95 {\%} confidence interval) times were 2.2 (1.9-2.5) and 89.8 (80.1-100.7) min, respectively (p < 0.0001, N = 134); maximum spontaneous recovery was 289.8 min. Safety was comparable between groups, with no recurrence of blockade. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms a prolonged residual blockade in patients who did not receive sugammadex, with median time to recovery > 1.5 h in the placebo group and one patient taking 4.8 h to achieve a safe level of neuromuscular function recovery following deep NMB. In contrast, sugammadex provided complete and reliable recovery of neuromuscular function (median time to recovery of 2.0 min). Thus, deep NMB with rocuronium until the end of the operation may be possible in combination with sugammadex reversal.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sugammadex, a modified gamma-cyclodextrin, is the first selective relaxant binding agent that specifically encapsulates the steroidal neuromuscular blocking agent, rocuronium. The action of rocuronium is prolonged in patients with renal failure. As sugammadex is primarily cleared renally, this phase III trial investigated the efficacy and safety of sugammadex for reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block (NMB) in patients with end-stage renal failure. METHODS: Thirty adult patients were studied: 15 renally impaired {$[$}creatinine clearance (CL(CR)) <30 ml min(-1){$]$} and 15 controls (CL(CR)>80 ml min(-1)). Anaesthesia was induced and maintained using i.v. opiates and propofol. Neuromuscular monitoring was performed by acceleromyography and train-of-four (TOF) nerve stimulation. Rocuronium (0.6 mg kg(-1)) was given, followed by a single i.v. dose of sugammadex (2.0 mg kg(-1)) at reappearance of the second twitch of the TOF. The primary efficacy variable was time from administration of sugammadex to recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.9. Safety variables included clinical evidence of reoccurrence of NMB. RESULTS: After sugammadex administration, the mean (sd) time to recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.9 was 2.0 (0.72) min in renal patients and 1.65 (0.63) min in controls (NS). Recurrence of NMB was not observed in any patient. No sugammadex-related serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Sugammadex administered at reappearance of T(2) rapidly and effectively reverses NMB induced by rocuronium in renal failure and healthy patients. Sugammadex was well tolerated by all patients. Further safety studies on sugammadex in patients with severe renal impairment are warranted.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Residual neuromuscular block has been associated with postoperative pulmonary complications. We hypothesised that sugammadex reduces postoperative pulmonary complications in patients aged ≥70 yr having surgery ≥3 h, compared with neostigmine. METHODS: Patients were enrolled in an open-label, assessor-blinded, randomised, controlled trial. At surgical closure, subjects were equally randomised to receive sugammadex 2 mg kg(-1) or neostigmine 0.07 mg kg(-1) (maximum 5 mg) for rocuronium reversal. The primary endpoint was incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications. Secondary endpoints included residual paralysis (train-of-four ratio <0.9 in the PACU) and Phase 1 recovery (time to attain pain control and stable respiratory, haemodynamic, and neurological status). The analysis was by intention-to-treat. RESULTS: Of the 200 subjects randomised, 98 received sugammadex and 99 received neostigmine. There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint of postoperative pulmonary complications despite a signal towards reduced incidence for sugammadex (33{\%} vs 40{\%}; odds ratio {$[$}OR{$]$}=0.74; 95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$}={$[$}0.40, 1.37{$]$}; P=0.30) compared with neostigmine. Sugammadex decreased residual neuromuscular block (10{\%} vs 49{\%}; OR=0.11, 95{\%} CI={$[$}0.04, 0.25{$]$}; P<0.001). Phase 1 recovery time was comparable between sugammadex (97.3 min {$[$}standard deviation, sd=54.3{$]$}) and neostigmine (110.0 min {$[$}sd=62.0{$]$}), difference -12.7 min (95{\%} CI, {$[$}-29.2, 3.9{$]$}, P=0.13). In an exploratory analysis, there were fewer 30 day hospital readmissions in the sugammadex group compared with the neostigmine group (5{\%} vs 15{\%}; OR=0.30, 95{\%} CI={$[$}0.08, 0.91{$]$}; P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: In older adults undergoing prolonged surgery, sugammadex was associated with a 40{\%} reduction in residual neuromuscular block, a 10{\%} reduction in 30 day hospital readmission rate, but no difference in the occurrence of postoperative pulmonary complications. Based on this exploratory study, larger studies should determine whether sugammadex may reduce postoperative pulmonary complications and 30 day hospital readmissions.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Less residual paralysis in recovery room was demonstrated when train-of-four (TOF) monitoring was applied. The aim of this study was to know whether optimisation of neostigmine reversal without TOF monitoring was equivalent to reversal using TOF monitoring. METHODS: Seventy two patients, aged 18-60 years, undergoing elective surgery under general anaesthesia (sevoflurane and rocuronium) with intubation were randomised into two interventions: an optimised neostigmine reversal strategy without TOF monitoring (group A, n = 36) and a neostigmine reversal strategy using quantitative TOF monitoring (group B, n = 36). Per-protocol analysis was performed to compare incidence of residual paralysis in the recovery room between the two groups. RESULTS: Six residual paralyses occurred in group A in the recovery room, whereas one case occurred in group B. The equivalence test showed that the 95{\%} confidence interval of this study was outside the range of equivalence margin (15{\%}). The absolute difference was 13.9{\%}: standard error (SE) =0.068 (P = 0.107; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1{\%}, 27.2{\%}). No subjects had TOF ratio <0.70 in the recovery room. The TOF ratio in the recovery room did not differ between the two groups (mean difference: -2.58; P = 0.05; 95{\%} CI: -5.20, 0.29). One respiratory adverse event occurred in this study. CONCLUSION: An optimised reversal strategy without TOF monitoring is not equivalent to a reversal strategy based on quantitative TOF monitoring. TOF monitoring should be used whenever applicable, although neostigmine is optimised.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sugammadex is a modified gamma cyclodextrin compound which encapsulates rocuronium resulting in rapid reversal of residual neuromuscular blockade. We performed a post hoc analysis of data from a multicenter study designed to mimic standard clinical practice which would test the hypothesis that the presence (versus the absence) of a twitch response to neuromuscular stimulation at the time of reversal drug administration would influence the speed and completeness of the reversal effect of sugammadex. METHODS: One-hundred-seventy-one consenting patients undergoing general anesthesia with a volatile-based anesthetic technique were enrolled in a multicenter observational study. All patients received rocuronium, 0.6 mg/kg i.v. for tracheal intubation and maintenance boluses of 0.15 mg/kg i.v. as needed during surgery. The degree of rocuronium-induced blockade was assessed during anesthesia using a TOF-Watch-SX acceleromyograph to record the train-of-four (TOF) responses on a laptop computer from induction of anesthesia until the TOF ratio returned to > or = 0.9 after completion of the surgical procedure. The patients received sugammadex, 4 mg/kg i.v., for reversal of neuromuscular blockade > 15 min after the last dose of rocuronium. Recovery data were compared in patients with either no (0) (n = 89) or > or = 1 twitch (n = 82) in response to TOF stimulation at the time of reversal drug administration. RESULTS: The patients without a twitch response were more likely to be female (60{\%} vs 40{\%}) and had a shorter time interval between the last bolus dose of rocuronium and the administration of the reversal drug (31+/-18 vs 45+/-23 min, P < 0.05). The time to achieve a TOF ratio of 0.9 was prolonged in the 0 twitch group compared with the > or = 1 twitch response group (173+/-162 vs 104+/-73 s, P < 0.05). Overall, 84{\%} of the patients in the 0 twitch group recovered to a TOF of 0.9 in < or = 5 min compared to 91{\%} of the patients in the group with > or = 1 twitch (P < 0.05). The times to achieve a TOF of 0.9 varied from 0.8 to 22.3 and 0.7 to 8.5 min in the 0 twitch and > or = 1 twitch groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: Reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade by sugammadex was influenced by the degree of residual blockade at the time the reversal drug was administered. Despite the wide variability, reversal of the TOF ratio to 0.9 occurred < or = 5 min in more than 80{\%} of the patients regardless of the number of twitches at the time of reversal drug administration.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study compared efficacy and safety of the selective relaxant binding agent sugammadex (2 mg/kg) with neostigmine (50 μg/kg) for neuromuscular blockade (NMB) reversal in Chinese and Caucasian subjects. METHODS: This was a randomized, active-controlled, multicenter, safety-assessor-blinded study (NCT00825812) in American Society of Anesthesiologists Class 1-3 subjects undergoing surgery with propofol anesthesia. Rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg was administered for endotracheal intubation, with 0.1-0.2 mg/kg maintenance doses given as required. NMB was monitored using TOF-Watch({\textregistered}) SX. At second twitch reappearance, after last rocuronium dose, subjects received sugammadex 2 mg/kg or neostigmine 50 μg/kg plus atropine 10-20 μg/kg, according to randomization. Primary efficacy variable was time from sugammadex/neostigmine to recovery of the train-of-four (TOF) ratio to 0.9. RESULTS: Overall, 230 Chinese subjects (sugammadex, n = 119, neostigmine, n = 111); and 59 Caucasian subjects (sugammadex, n = 29, neostigmine, n = 30) had evaluable data. Geometric mean (95{\%} CI) time to recovery to TOF ratio 0.9 was 1.6 (1.5-1.7) min with sugammadex vs 9.1 (8.0-10.3) min with neostigmine in Chinese subjects. Corresponding times for Caucasian subjects were 1.4 (1.3-1.5) min and 6.7 (5.5-8.0) min, respectively. Sugammadex 2 mg/kg was generally well tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported. There was no residual NMB or recurrence of NMB. CONCLUSION: Both Chinese and Caucasian subjects recovered from NMB significantly faster after sugammadex 2 mg/kg vs neostigmine 50 μg/kg, with a \~{}5.7 times (p < 0.0001) faster recovery with sugammadex vs neostigmine in Chinese subjects. Sugammadex was generally well tolerated. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00825812.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The importance of the characteristics of anesthesia and postoperative residual curarization (PORC) in the elderly population should be a growing concern in this century. AIMS: To investigate the effect of sugammadex on the duration of the recovery from neuromuscular blocking agents and postoperative residual curarization in the young elderly and middle-aged elderly patients who underwent elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy, followed by a train of four (TOF) watch monitorization. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective clinical trial study. METHODS: Sixty patients over the age of 65 with American Society of Anesthesiologists I-III were divided into two groups according to their age (65-74 years old and ≥75 years old). Patients received sugammadex (2.0 mg/kg iv) at the reappearance of the second twitch of the TOF as an agent for reversal of neuromuscular blockage at the end of surgery. Patients were extubated at the time of TOF ≥0.9. The patients' TOF responses were evaluated with regards to PORC in at the 5th minute and were followed up for one hour in the recovery room. Reintubation was applied for those patients who developed PORC and had peripheric oxygen saturation <90{\%} despite being given 6 L oxygen per min with a face mask. RESULTS: The onset time of neuromuscular blocking agent and time from T2 to achieve TOF ratio 90{\%} (the duration of sugammadex effect) or over were found to be longer in the middle-aged elderly group than in the young elderly group. A statistically significant relationship was found between age and the duration of TOF ratio to reach 0.9 in the same direction. The PORC incidence and rate of reintubation were found to be 1.7{\%} in all patients. CONCLUSION: In our opinion, it is necessary to remember that the duration of sugammadex effect on the recovery period is prolonged for patients who are aged ≥75 years compared to patients aged between 65-74 years.
