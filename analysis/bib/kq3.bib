	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence that the incidence of postoperative residual paresis after using neuromuscular blockers ranges from 24 to 50{\%} in post anaesthesia care unit (PACU) and is associated with postoperative complications such as critical respiratory events as evidenced by hypoxia, hypoventilation and upper airway obstruction. Quantitative neuromuscular monitoring (such as the assessment of Train of four (TOF) ratio) and reversal of neuromuscular blockers has been shown to reduce postoperative residual paresis. There are very few outcome studies on effect of residual paresis in PACU. There is a paucity of published randomized controlled trials investigating whether using a TOF ratio ≥0.9 before endotracheal extubation compared to clinical assessment of return of neuromuscular function reduces the incidence of critical respiratory events in PACU. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether using TOF ratio ≥0.9 compared to clinical assessment of return of neuromuscular function before endotracheal extubation reduces the incidence of critical respiratory events in PACU. METHODS: Onehundred sixty eight adult patients in ASA physical status I and II requiring general anaesthesia for elective surgery with cisatracurium as the muscle relaxant were randomized into 2 groups of 84 each. Group 1 were patients who required a TOF ratio of ≥0.9 before extubation. Group 2 patients were extubated based on clinical assessment of return of adequate neuromuscular function by the anaesthetist as is the standard of practice at the Aga Khan University hospital Nairobi. General anaesthesia was standardized in both groups. Both the investigators and patients were blinded during the study.Once the patient was transferred to PACU, oxygen saturation (SP02), respiratory rate and any signs of upper airway obstruction as demonstrated by stridor, laryngospasms or requirement of any airway manipulation was recorded for the first 30 minutes. Duration of anaesthesia and surgery was also recorded. Patient demographics were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference between the 2 groups in terms of patient demographics, duration of surgery and anaesthesia and duration since last muscle relaxant was given. In terms of hypoxia on arrival in PACU, the incidence of mild hypoxia (SPO2 90-93{\%}) was 11{\%} in clinical assessment groupversus 5{\%} in TOF group P-value 0.149 while severe hypoxia (SPO2 <90{\%}) was 19{\%} versus 10{\%} P-value 0.078. During the first 30 minutes in PACU, the incidence of mild hypoxia (SPO2 90-93{\%}) was statistically significant between the 2 groups (12{\%} in clinical assessment group versus 1{\%} in TOF group, P-value 0.005) while severe hypoxia (SPO2 <90{\%}) was 7{\%} versus 5{\%}, P-value 0.373. The incidence of upper airway obstruction was statistically significant between the two groups (45{\%} in clinical assessment group versus 14{\%} in TOF group P-value<0.0001 for patients requiring airway maneuver, 21{\%} versus 2{\%} P-value <0.0001 for those who required tactile stimulation and 31{\%} versus 12{\%} were snoring, P-value 0.003. Logistic regression analysis revealed TOF group was less likely associated with mild hypoxia (OR 0.09 95{\%} CI 0.01-0.71 P-value 0.023), tactile stimulation (OR 0.09 95{\%} CI 0.02-0.40 P-value 0.002), airway maneuver (OR 0.20 95{\%} CI 0.10-0.43 P-value <0.001) and snoring (OR 0.30 95{\%} CI 0.13-0.68 P-value 0.04). CONCLUSION: Among this population, there is a lower incidence of critical respiratory events in PACU with the use of neuromuscular monitoring using TOF ratio ≥0.9 to assess neuromuscular function before endotracheal extubation compared with the use of clinical assessment methods.},

@article{Domenech:2019td,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Complete avoidance of residual neuromuscular blockade (RNMB) during the postoperative period has not yet been achieved in current anesthesia practice. Evidently, compliance with NMB monitoring is persistently low, and the risk of RNMB during the perioperative period remains underestimated. To our knowledge, no publications have reported the incidence of RNMB in a university hospital where access to quantitative NMB monitoring and sugammadex is unlimited and where NMB management is not protocolised. The primary aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of RNMB in patients managed with or without sugammadex or neostigmine as antagonists and quantitative NMB monitoring in the operating room. The secondary aim was to explore the associations between RNMB and potentially related variables. METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort study was conducted at a tertiary referral university hospital in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Records created between June 2015 and December 2015 were reviewed. In total, 240 consecutive patients who had undergone elective surgical procedures requiring NMB were included. All patients were monitored via acceleromyography at the adductor pollicis muscle within 5 min of arrival in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU). Scheduled recovery in the intensive care unit was the only exclusion criterion. RESULTS: RNMB was present in 1.6{\%} patients who received intra-operative quantitative NMB monitoring and 32{\%} patients whose NMB was not monitored (P <  0.01). Multivariable analysis revealed that the use of intra-operative quantitative NMB monitoring and sugammadex were associated with a lower incidence of RNMB, with calculated odds ratios of 0.04 (95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$}: 0.005 to 0.401) and 0.18 (95{\%} CI: 0.046 to 0.727), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study suggest that intra-operative quantitative NMB monitoring and use of sugammadex are associated with a decreased incidence of RNMB in the PACU, reinforcing the contention that the optimal strategy for RNMB avoidance is the use of quantitative NMB monitoring and eventual use of reversal agents, if needed, prior to emergence from anaesthesia.},

@article{Fruergaard:1998uv,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Routine perioperative monitoring with accelero-myography might prevent residual block, whereas routine tactile evaluation of the response to train-of-four (TOF) nerve stimulation does not. The purpose of this prospective, randomised and blinded study was to evaluate the effect of manual evaluation of the response to double burst stimulation (DBS3.3) upon the incidence of residual block. METHODS: Sixty adult patients scheduled for elective abdominal surgery were included in the study. Pancuronium 0.08 to 0.1 mg kg-1 was given for relaxation and tracheal intubation. For maintenance of neuromuscular block, pancuronium 1-2 mg was administered. The patients were randomly allocated into two groups. In group DBS (double burst stimulation) the degree of block during anaesthesia was assessed by manual evaluation of the response to TOF nerve stimulation. During reversal, when no fade was detectable in the TOF response, the stimulation pattern was changed to DBS3.3. The trachea was extubated when the anaesthetist judged the neuromuscular function to have recovered adequately and no fade in the DBS3.3 response could be felt. In group CC (clinical criteria) patients were managed without the use of a nerve stimulator, and the level of neuromuscular block and reversal were evaluated solely on the basis of clinical criteria. In both groups, the TOF ratio was measured by mechanomyography immediately after tracheal extubation. Also, the ability to sustain head lift for 5 s, to protrude the tongue, to open the eyes, and to lift one arm to the opposite shoulder were tested. RESULTS: The TOF ratio, as measured immediately after tracheal extubation, was significantly lower in group CC than in group DBS (means: 0.68 and 0.78, respectively), and the incidence of residual neuromuscular block defined as a TOF ratio < 0.7 was significantly higher in group CC than in group DBS (57 and 24{\%}, respectively). The time from the first TOF measurement until the TOF ratio reached 0.8 was significantly longer in group CC than in group DBs (means: 11.5 and 6.2 min, respectively). No significant differences between the two groups of patients were found in duration of anaesthesia, in times from end of surgery to injection of neostigmine, tracheal extubation or TOF ratio 0.8, in dose of pancuronium, or in any other postoperative variable. CONCLUSION: Routine perioperative manual evaluation of the responses to TOF and DBS3.3 decreased the incidence and the degree of residual block following the use of pancuronium. It did not, however, exclude clinically significant residual paralysis, nor did it influence the amount of pancuronium used during the operation, the duration of anaesthesia or the time from end of surgery to tracheal extubation or to sufficient recovery of neuromuscular function (TOF = 0.8).},

@article{Gatke:2002vv,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Residual muscle paralysis after anesthesia is common after pancuronium, but less common following the intermediate-acting drugs vecuronium and atracurium. Therefore, many anesthetists do not monitor neuromuscular function when using an intermediate-acting agent. The purpose of this prospective, randomised and double-blind study was to establish the incidence and degree of postoperative residual block following the use of rocuronium in patients not monitored with a nerve stimulator, and to compare it with results obtained in patients monitored using acceleromyography (AMG). METHODS: During propofol/opioid anesthesia, 120 adult patients were randomised to two groups, one monitored with AMG, the other using only clinical criteria without a nerve stimulator. Postoperatively, TOF-ratio was measured with mechanomyography; a TOF-ratio < 0.80 indicated residual muscle paralysis. RESULTS: Residual muscle paralysis was found in 10 patients in the group without neuromuscular monitoring (16.7{\%}) (95{\%} confidence interval, 12-21{\%}) and in two patients in the AMG-monitored group (3{\%}) (95{\%} CI, 0-8{\%}); (P = 0.029, Fisher's exact test). Time from end of surgery to tracheal extubation was significantly longer in the AMG-monitored group (12.5 min) than in the group not monitored with AMG (10 min). CONCLUSION: Clinical evaluation of recovery of neuromuscular function does not exclude significant residual paralysis following the intermediate-acting muscle relaxant rocuronium, but the problem of residual block can be minimized by use of AMG.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In clinical practice, in the majority of patients, recovery from the effect of muscle relaxants is assessed using subjective methods such as head lift, eye-opening, or by sustained hand grip after giving anticholinesterases (neostigmine) at the end of surgery. We planned a prospective observational cohort study to test the hypothesis that objective neuromuscular monitoring can help us in avoiding the use of anticholinesterases for reversal. METHODS: The patients posted for surgery of <2 h duration were included in the study. The cohort of patients was formed on the basis of those who were exposed to objective neuromuscular monitoring of recovery (train-of-four {$[$}TOF{$]$} ratio of 0.9 or more; exposed group) and the patients who were not exposed to objective neuromuscular monitoring (non-exposed group) acting as a control. Using objective neuromuscular monitoring, the time required for recovery from muscle relaxation when neostigmine was not given for reversal was noted and it was then compared with that of the control group. RESULTS: A total of 190 patients were enrolled over a period of 3 years. With the use of TOF ratio of 0.9 for extubation, patients safely recovered from neuromuscular blockade, without using neostigmine, with no difference in the mean recovery time (14.48 $\pm$1.138 min) as compared to the control group (12.14 $\pm$1.067 min, P = 0.139). There was no incidence of reintubation in post-operative period. CONCLUSION: With objective neuromuscular monitoring, we can ensure complete recovery from the neuromuscular blockade while avoiding the use of anticholinesterases.},

@article{Kirmeier:2019vm,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Results from retrospective studies suggest that use of neuromuscular blocking agents during general anaesthesia might be linked to postoperative pulmonary complications. We therefore aimed to assess whether the use of neuromuscular blocking agents is associated with postoperative pulmonary complications. METHODS: We did a multicentre, prospective observational cohort study. Patients were recruited from 211 hospitals in 28 European countries. We included patients (aged ≥18 years) who received general anaesthesia for any in-hospital procedure except cardiac surgery. Patient characteristics, surgical and anaesthetic details, and chart review at discharge were prospectively collected over 2 weeks. Additionally, each patient underwent postoperative physical examination within 3 days of surgery to check for adverse pulmonary events. The study outcome was the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications from the end of surgery up to postoperative day 28. Logistic regression analyses were adjusted for surgical factors and patients' preoperative physical status, providing adjusted odds ratios (OR(adj)) and adjusted absolute risk reduction (ARR(adj)). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01865513. FINDINGS: Between June 16, 2014, and April 29, 2015, data from 22 803 patients were collected. The use of neuromuscular blocking agents was associated with an increased incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications in patients who had undergone general anaesthesia (1658 {$[$}7·6{\%}{$]$} of 21 694); OR(adj) 1·86, 95{\%} CI 1·53-2·26; ARR(adj) -4·4{\%}, 95{\%} CI -5·5 to -3·2). Only 2·3{\%} of high-risk surgical patients and those with adverse respiratory profiles were anaesthetised without neuromuscular blocking agents. The use of neuromuscular monitoring (OR(adj) 1·31, 95{\%} CI 1·15-1·49; ARR(adj) -2·6{\%}, 95{\%} CI -3·9 to -1·4) and the administration of reversal agents (1·23, 1·07-1·41; -1·9{\%}, -3·2 to -0·7) were not associated with a decreased risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. Neither the choice of sugammadex instead of neostigmine for reversal (OR(adj) 1·03, 95{\%} CI 0·85-1·25; ARR(adj) -0·3{\%}, 95{\%} CI -2·4 to 1·5) nor extubation at a train-of-four ratio of 0·9 or more (1·03, 0·82-1·31; -0·4{\%}, -3·5 to 2·2) was associated with better pulmonary outcomes. INTERPRETATION: We showed that the use of neuromuscular blocking drugs in general anaesthesia is associated with an increased risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. Anaesthetists must balance the potential benefits of neuromuscular blockade against the increased risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. FUNDING: European Society of Anaesthesiology.},

	abstract = {The frequency of postoperative residual neuromuscular block following the use of the long-acting non-depolarizing muscle relaxants is high, and manual evaluation of the response to nerve stimulation does not eliminate the problem. In this prospective and randomized study we evaluated the hypothesis that perioperative use of acceleromyography would allow for a more rational and precise administration of the long-acting muscle relaxant pancuronium resulting in a decrease in 1) the incidence and severity of postoperative residual neuromuscular block, 2) the amount of pancuronium used, and 3) the time from end of surgery to tracheal extubation. Forty adult patients were randomized into two groups, one managed without the use of a nerve stimulator, the other monitored using train-of-four (TOF) nerve stimulation and acceleromyography. All patients were anaesthetized with diazepam, fentanyl, thiopentone, nitrous oxide, and in some patients halothane, and they all received pancuronium 0.08-0.1 mg kg-1 for tracheal intubation, and 1-2 mg for maintenance of neuromuscular block. Neostigmine 2.5 mg preceded by atropine 1 mg was administered for reversal. In the patients managed without a nerve stimulator, the trachea was extubated when the anaesthetist judged the neuromuscular function to have recovered adequately for upper airway protection and spontaneous ventilation. In patients monitored with acceleromyography, the trachea was extubated when the TOF ratio was above 0.70. In all 40 patients, TOF ratio was measured using mechanomyography immediately after tracheal extubation and the patients were evaluated for clinical signs of residual neuromuscular block.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Incomplete recovery from neuromuscular blockade in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) may contribute to adverse postoperative respiratory events. This study determined the incidence and degree of residual neuromuscular blockade in patients randomized to conventional qualitative train-of-four (TOF) monitoring or quantitative acceleromyographic monitoring. The incidence of adverse respiratory events in the PACU was also evaluated. METHODS: One hundred eighty-five patients were randomized to intraoperative acceleromyographic monitoring (acceleromyography group) or qualitative TOF monitoring (TOF group). Anesthetic management was standardized. TOF patients were extubated when standard criteria were met and no fade was observed during TOF stimulation. Acceleromyography patients had a TOF ratio of greater than 0.80 as an additional extubation criterion. Upon arrival in the PACU, TOF ratios of both groups were measured with acceleromyography. Adverse respiratory events during transport to the PACU and during the first 30 min of PACU admission were also recorded. RESULTS: A lower frequency of residual neuromuscular blockade in the PACU (TOF ratio < or = 0.9) was observed in the acceleromyography group (4.5{\%}) compared with the conventional TOF group (30.0{\%}; P < 0.0001). During transport to the PACU, fewer acceleromyography patients developed arterial oxygen saturation values, measured by pulse oximetry, of less than 90{\%} (0{\%}) or airway obstruction (0{\%}) compared with TOF patients (21.1{\%} and 11.1{\%}, respectively; P < 0.002). The incidence, severity, and duration of hypoxemic events during the first 30 min of PACU admission were less in the acceleromyography group (all P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Incomplete neuromuscular recovery can be minimized with acceleromyographic monitoring. The risk of adverse respiratory events during early recovery from anesthesia can be reduced by intraoperative acceleromyography use.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The subjective experience of residual neuromuscular blockade after emergence from anesthesia has not been examined systematically during postanesthesia care unit (PACU) stays. The authors hypothesized that acceleromyography monitoring would diminish unpleasant symptoms of residual paresis during recovery from anesthesia by reducing the percentage of patients with train-of-four ratios less than 0.9. METHODS: One hundred fifty-five patients were randomized to receive intraoperative acceleromyography monitoring (acceleromyography group) or conventional qualitative train-of-four monitoring (control group). Neuromuscular management was standardized, and extubation was performed when defined criteria were achieved. Immediately upon a patient's arrival to the PACU, the patient's train-of-four ratios were measured using acceleromyography, and a standardized examination was used to assess 16 symptoms and 11 signs of residual paresis. This examination was repeated 20, 40, and 60 min after PACU admission. RESULTS: The incidence of residual blockade (train-of-four ratios less than 0.9) was reduced in the acceleromyography group (14.5{\%} vs. 50.0{\%} control group, with the 99{\%} confidence interval for this 35.5{\%} difference being 16.4-52.6{\%}, P < 0.0001). Generalized linear models revealed the acceleromyography group had less overall weakness (graded on a 0-10 scale) and fewer symptoms of muscle weakness across all time points (P < 0.0001 for both analyses), but the number of signs of muscle weakness was small from the time of arrival in the PACU and did not differ between the groups at any time. CONCLUSION: Acceleromyography monitoring reduces the incidence of residual blockade and associated unpleasant symptoms of muscle weakness in the PACU and improves the overall quality of recovery.},

	abstract = {The authors conducted a randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the usefulness of perioperative manual evaluation of the response to train-of-four (TOF) nerve stimulation. A total of 80 patients were divided into four groups of 20 each. For two groups (one given vecuronium and one pancuronium), the anesthetists assessed the degree of neuromuscular blockade during operation and during recovery from neuromuscular blockade by manual evaluation of the response to TOF nerve stimulation. In the other two groups, one of which received vecuronium and the other pancuronium, the anesthetists evaluated the degree of neuromuscular blockade solely by clinical criteria. The use of a nerve stimulator was found to have no effect on the dose of relaxant given during anesthesia, on the need for supplementary doses of anticholinesterase in the recovery room, on the time from end of surgery to end of anesthesia, or on the incidence of postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade evaluated clinically. The median (and range of) TOF ratios recorded in the recovery room were 0.75 (0.33-0.96) and 0.79 (0.10-0.97) in the vecuronium groups monitored with and without a nerve stimulator, respectively. These ratios were significantly higher than those found in the pancuronium groups, which wre 0.66 (0.06-0.90) and 0.63 (0.29-0.95), respectively. However, no difference was found between the vecuronium and pancuronium groups in the number of patients showing clinical signs of residual neuromuscular blockade, as evaluated by the 5-s head-lift test.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

@article{Shorten:1995uk,
	abstract = {It has been suggested that perioperative train-of-four (TOF) monitoring does not reduce the incidence of postoperative residual curarization (PORC). The purpose of this study was to examine whether the use of tactile assessment of the response of the adductor pollicis to supramaximal TOF stimulation of the ulnar nerve at the wrist during anaesthesia affected the incidence of PORC. Thirty-nine ASA I or II surgical patients were studied during thiopentone/fentanyl N2O/enflurane anaesthesia. Pancuronium (70-100 micrograms.kg-1) was used to facilitate tracheal intubation and additional pancuronium increments used to maintain surgical relaxation. The requirement for incremental doses of pancuronium and adequacy of recovery following reversal were assessed according to random allocation, either with (Group A; n = 20) or without (Group B; n = 19) access to TOF monitoring. Patients in the two groups received neostigmine in similar doses (Group A: 53 micrograms.kg-1 (5.9); Group B: 55 micrograms.kg-1 (5.4)). On arrival of the patient to the recovery area, neuromuscular function was assessed electromyographically (using the Datex NMT 221 to measure TOF ratio) and clinically. The incidence of PORC (TOF ratio < 70{\%}) was greater in Group B (47{\%}) than in Group A (15{\%}) (P = 0.029). We conclude that the use of perioperative TOF monitoring decreases the incidence of pancuronium-induced PORC.},

@article{Todd:2014ts,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although experts agree on the importance of quantitative neuromuscular blockade monitoring, particularly for managing reversal, such monitoring is not in widespread use. We describe the processes and results of our departmental experience with the introduction of such quantitative monitoring. METHODS: In mid-2010, the senior authors became concerned about the management of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers (NMB) by providers within the department, based on personal observations and on a review of a departmental quality assurance/adverse event database. This review indicated the occurrence of 2 to 4 reintubations/year in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) that were deemed to be probably or possibly related to inadequate reversal. In response, quantitative blockade equipment (Datex-Omeda ElectroSensor{\texttrademark}EMG system) was installed in all our main operating rooms in January 2011. This introduction was accompanied by an extensive educational effort. Adoption of the system was slow; by mid-2011, the quantitative system was being used in <50{\%} of cases involving nondepolarizing relaxants and adverse NMB-related events continued to occur. Therefore, starting in August 2011 and extending over the next 2 years, we performed a series of 5 separate sampling surveys in the PACU in which train-of-four (TOF) ratios were recorded in 409 tracheally extubated adult patients who had received nondepolarizing NMB (almost exclusively rocuronium) as well as in 73 patients who had not received any nondepolarizing NMB. After each survey, the results were presented to the entire department, along with discussions of individual cases, reviews of the recent literature regarding quantitative monitoring and further education regarding the use of the quantitative system. RESULTS: In the initial (August 2011) PACU survey of 96 patients receiving nondepolarizing NMBs, 31{\%} had a TOF ratio of ≤0.9, 17{\%} had a ratio of ≤0.8, and 4 patients (4{\%}) had ratios of ≤0.5. A record review showed that the quantitative monitoring system had been used to monitor reversal in only 51{\%} of these patients, and 23{\%} of patients had no evidence of any monitoring, including qualitative TOF assessment. By December of 2012 (after 2 interim PACU monitoring surveys), a fourth survey showed 15{\%} of 101 monitored patients had a TOF ratio ≤0.9, and only 5{\%} had ratios ≤0.8. (P < 0.05 vs August 2011). Clear documentation of reversal using the quantitative system was present in 83{\%} of cases (P < 0.05 vs August 2011). A final survey in July 2013 showed nearly identical values to those from December 2012. The lowest TOF ratio observed in any patient not receiving a nondepolarizing NMB was 0.92. There were no changes in the patterns of either rocuronium or neostigmine use over the duration of the project (through December 2012), and there have been no cases of NMB-related reintubations in the PACU during the last 2 years. DISCUSSION: Implementation of universal electromyographic-based quantitative neuromuscular blockade monitoring required a sustained process of education along with repeated PACU surveys and feedback to providers. Nevertheless, this effort resulted in a significant reduction in the incidence of incompletely reversed patients in the PACU.},

Ninety patients were allocated to three equal groups.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Less residual paralysis in recovery room was demonstrated when train-of-four (TOF) monitoring was applied. The aim of this study was to know whether optimisation of neostigmine reversal without TOF monitoring was equivalent to reversal using TOF monitoring. METHODS: Seventy two patients, aged 18-60 years, undergoing elective surgery under general anaesthesia (sevoflurane and rocuronium) with intubation were randomised into two interventions: an optimised neostigmine reversal strategy without TOF monitoring (group A, n = 36) and a neostigmine reversal strategy using quantitative TOF monitoring (group B, n = 36). Per-protocol analysis was performed to compare incidence of residual paralysis in the recovery room between the two groups. RESULTS: Six residual paralyses occurred in group A in the recovery room, whereas one case occurred in group B. The equivalence test showed that the 95{\%} confidence interval of this study was outside the range of equivalence margin (15{\%}). The absolute difference was 13.9{\%}: standard error (SE) =0.068 (P = 0.107; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1{\%}, 27.2{\%}). No subjects had TOF ratio <0.70 in the recovery room. The TOF ratio in the recovery room did not differ between the two groups (mean difference: -2.58; P = 0.05; 95{\%} CI: -5.20, 0.29). One respiratory adverse event occurred in this study. CONCLUSION: An optimised reversal strategy without TOF monitoring is not equivalent to a reversal strategy based on quantitative TOF monitoring. TOF monitoring should be used whenever applicable, although neostigmine is optimised.},
