	abstract = {We have studied the pattern of blood flow and pharmacodynamic profile of mivacurium-induced block at the adductor pollicis and orbicularis oculi muscles. We studied 30 adult patients anaesthetized with fentanyl, thiopentone, nitrous oxide-isoflurane, and mivacurium 0.2 mg kg-1. Neuromuscular transmission was monitored with accelerometry (TOF Guard, Biometer, Denmark). Blood flow was measured at the two muscles with the use of a laser Doppler flowmeter (Laserflo BPM2, Vasamedics, USA). All patients developed 100{\%} neuromuscular block at the adductor pollicis muscle. Mean maximum neuromuscular block at the orbicularis oculi was 96.4 (SD 3.5){\%} (ns). Onset time, time required for 25{\%} and 75{\%} recovery of the first twitch in the train-of-four (T1), and a train-of-four ratio (T4/T1) of 90{\%} at the orbicularis oculi were respectively, mean 130.4 (SD 28.5) s, 9.1 (3.2) min, 16.2 (3.9) min and 20.2 (4.3) min and were significantly shorter than the corresponding values at the adductor pollicis: 202.7 (37.2) s, 12.9 (3.9) min, 21.1 (5.1) min and 30.8 (7.4) min. For a given T1, there was significantly less train-of-four fade (T4/T1) at the orbicularis oculi than at the adductor pollicis muscle during recovery. Blood flow was comparable at the two muscles before induction of anaesthesia. Thiopentone significantly increased thenar muscle blood flow from 2.9 (1.5) to 12.3 (6.8) ml 100 g-1 min-1, with a further increase to 22.7 (8.0) ml 100 g-1 min-1 after isoflurane (P < 0.001). Blood flow at the orbicularis oculi was not altered by thiopentone or isoflurane and was consistently lower than that at the adductor pollicis muscle. We conclude that the different pharmacodynamic profiles of mivacurium-induced block at the orbicularis oculi and adductor pollicis muscles were not related primarily to a difference in blood flows.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Some studies suggest that the orbicularis oculi is resistant to neuromuscular blocking drugs and behaves like laryngeal muscles. Others report little or no difference between the orbicularis oculi and the adductor pollicis. These discrepancies could be related to the exact site of recording. The purpose of this study was to compare two monitoring sites around the eye with the adductor pollicis and the laryngeal adductor muscles. METHODS: After institutional approval and informed consent, the evoked response to train-of-four stimulation was measured in 12 patients by acceleromyography at the thumb (adductor pollicis), the eyelid (orbicularis oculi), and the superciliary arch (corrugator supercilii) after 0.5 mg/kg rocuronium during propofol-fentanyl-nitrous oxide anesthesia. In 12 other patients, laryngeal adductor neuromuscular blockade was assessed via the cuff of the tracheal tube and compared with the adductor pollicis and the corrugator supercilii after 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium. RESULTS: After 0.5 mg/kg, maximum blockade ({\%}T1, mean +/- SD) was less at the corrugator supercilii (80+/-20{\%}) than at the adductor pollicis (100+/-1{\%}) and the orbicularis oculi (93+/-8{\%}) (P < 0.01). Clinical duration (25{\%}T1) was shorter at the corrugator supercilii (12+/-7 min) than at the adductor pollicis (25+/-4 min) and orbicularis oculi (24+/-10 min) (P < 0.01). After 0.6 mg/kg, maximum blockade was similar at the corrugator supercilii (88+/-8{\%}) and the laryngeal adductor muscles (89+/-11{\%}). Clinical duration at the corrugator supercilii and the laryngeal adductors was 17+/-7 and 17+/-10 min, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Muscles around the eye vary in their response to rocuronium. The response of the superciliary arch (corrugator supercilii) reflects blockade of laryngeal adductor muscles. However, the eyelid (orbicularis oculi) and thumb (adductor pollicis) have similar sensitivities.},

	abstract = {Neuromuscular blockade monitoring at the adductor pollicis has become easier using acceleromyography. In order to guarantee a reliable analysis of its acceleration, the thumb movement has to be free and protected from external influences. To this end, we describe here-in two hand fixation- and protection-devices for use with acceleromyography. After a bolus of 0.3 mg/kg rocuronium, we compared acceleromyography data obtained simultaneously on both hands with, on one side, the cumbersome TOF-Guard/TOF-Watch arm board, and the smaller and handier TOF-tube on the other. Results showed little differences between the two devices. Yet, a short and clinically irrelevant delay was observed for TOF-tube data during recovery. This was probably caused by a difference in thumb position and repositioning technique. In conclusion, the more convenient TOF-tube can be used as well as the TOF-Guard/TOF-Watch arm board in daily clinical practice.},

@article{Larsen:2002wa,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The orbicularis oculi (OO) muscle has been recommended for neuromuscular monitoring when the adductor pollicis (AP) muscle is not available. We investigated whether neuromuscular block could be measured reliably from the orbital part of the OO muscle by the use of acceleromyography. METHODS: During propofol, fentanyl, and alfentanil anaesthesia two TOF-Guards (Organon Teknika NV, Boxtel, the Netherlands) with acceleration transducers placed on the distal phalanx of the thumb and over the middle of the eyebrow, respectively, were used to measure neuromuscular block simultaneously in 23 patients during vecuronium-induced and neostigmine-antagonized neuromuscular block. For both muscles, the simultaneously recorded first response (T1) in the train-of-four (TOF) and TOF-ratio were measured both during onset and recovery of the block. Furthermore, both the AP muscle T1 and TOF-ratio responses were plotted against 10{\%} intervals of the OO muscle responses during onset and recovery, respectively. RESULTS: The orbicularis oculi muscle had a shorter latency and a faster recovery to TOF-ratio 0.80 compared with the AP muscle. During onset and recovery, pronounced variations of the AP muscle T1 and TOF-ratio responses were observed when compared with the OO muscle. CONCLUSION: A significant clinical disagreement exists between the degree of paralysis measured at the OO and the AP muscles. It is impossible to obtain a reasonable estimate of the degree of block at the AP muscle when the block is measured from the OO muscle with acceleromyography. If used, there is substantial risk of overlooking a residual block, and adequate recovery of the block should be confirmed by a final AP muscle measurement.},

@article{Capron:2004tn,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The incidence of residual paralysis, i.e., a mechanomyographic train-of-four (TOF) ratio (T4/T1) less than 0.9, remains frequent. Routine acceleromyography has been proposed to detect residual paralysis in clinical practice. Although acceleromyographic data are easy to obtain, they differ from mechanomyographic data, with which they are not interchangeable. The current study aimed to determine (1) the acceleromyographic TOF ratio that detects residual paralysis with a 95{\%} probability, and (2) the impact of calibration and normalization on this predictive acceleromyographic value. METHODS: In 60 patients, recovery from neuromuscular block was assessed simultaneously with mechanomyography and acceleromyography. To obtain calibrated acceleromyographic TOF ratios in group A, the implemented calibration modus 2 was activated in the TOF-Watch S; to obtain uncalibrated acceleromyographic TOF ratios in group B, the current was manually set at 50 mA (n = 30 for each). In addition, data in group B were normalized (i.e., dividing the final TOF ratio by the baseline value). The agreement between mechanomyography and acceleromyography was assessed by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient. Negative predictive values were calculated for detecting residual paralysis from acceleromyographic TOFs of 0.9, 0.95, and 1.0. GROUP A: : For a mechanomyographic TOF of 0.9 or greater, the corresponding acceleromyographic TOF was 0.95 (range, 0.86-1.0), and the negative predictive values for acceleromyographic TOFs of 0.9, 0.95, and 1.0 were 37{\%} (95{\%} CI, 20-56{\%}), 70{\%} (95{\%} CI, 51-85{\%}), and 97{\%} (95{\%} CI, 83-100{\%}), respectively. Group B: Without normalization, an acceleromyographic TOF of 0.97 (range, 0.68-1.18) corresponded to a mechanomyographic TOF of 0.9 or greater, with negative predictive values for acceleromyographic TOFs of 0.9, 0.95, and 1.0 being 40{\%} (95{\%} CI, 23-59{\%}), 60{\%} (95{\%} CI, 41-77{\%}), and 77{\%} (95{\%} CI, 58-90{\%}), respectively. After normalization, an acceleromyographic TOF of 0.89 (range, 0.63-1.06) corresponded to a mechanomyographic TOF of 0.9 or greater, and the negative predictive values of acceleromyographic TOFs of 0.9, 0.95, and 1.0 were 89{\%} (95{\%} CI, 70-98{\%}), 92{\%} (95{\%} CI, 75-99{\%}), and 96{\%} (95{\%} CI, 80-100{\%}), respectively. CONCLUSION: To exclude residual paralysis reliably when using acceleromyography, TOF recovery to 1.0 is mandatory.},

@article{Kopman:2005tv,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a considerable body of evidence which suggests that data obtained using acceleromyography (AMG) cannot be used interchangeably with observations obtained by mechanomyographic (MMG) or electromyograhic (EMG) methods. All previous such studies evaluated the responses from contralateral limbs. This investigation was undertaken to determine if these previously described differences were in part a function of observing the responses from opposing limbs. METHODS: We compared the ipsilateral EMG and AMG response to an ED(95) bolus of atracurium in 50 subjects. In half of the individuals the thumb was free to move freely; in half, a small elastic preload was applied to the thumb. Train-of-four (TOF) recovery was followed until a TOF ratio >0.90 was recorded by both monitors. Acceleromyography vs. EMG differences and the resultant 95{\%} confidence limits for twitch height (T1) and the TOF ratio were determined. RESULTS: When the AMG TOF value had recovered to a value of 0.72 +/- 0.03; the simultaneously evoked EMG value averaged only 0.59 +/- 0.08. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Although the mean difference AMG vs. EMG was little more than 0.10, differences in an individual might be twice that amount. When the AMG TOF value had recovered to 0.90, the simultaneously evoked EMG value averaged 0.85. Again the 95{\%} confidence limits for individual observations was very wide. With EMG, once the TOF ratio returns to a value of 0.70, T1 has returned to 95{\%} of control. In contrast with AMG, return of T1 -95{\%} of control requires a TOF ratio of almost 0.90. Addition of an elastic preload to the thumb decreased control TOF variability without effecting the relationship between twitch height and the TOF ratio. CONCLUSION: Acceleromyographic TOF values tend to overestimate the extent of EMG recovery. Acceleromyographic TOF values <0.90 are indicative of incomplete neuromuscular recovery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Post-tetanic count is a valuable method to assess profound neuromuscular blockade. However, subsequent responses to repetitive stimulation might be altered due to post tetanic facilitation (PTF). To avoid PTF, it has been advocated to limit the interval of stimulation from 6 to 10 min. The impact of PTF on 90{\%} recovery of the TOF ratio has not been evaluated. Therefore, we assessed the effect of repetitive PTC stimulation on atracurium blockade with the primary outcome being the time to reach 90{\%} TOF recovery in comparison to classical TOF stimulation. METHODS: After informed consent 20 patients ASA I-II, scheduled for peripheral surgery under general anaesthesia and requiring tracheal intubation were enrolled into the study. Anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl, propofol, and atracurium, 0.5 mg kg(-1). Neuromuscular characteristics were assessed at the adductor pollicis by a TOF Watch((R)) accelerometer (Organon, Teknika, Holland) on each arm. After onset of maximum neuromuscular blockade, repetitive PTC every 3 min on one arm and repetitive TOF stimulation every 15 s on the opposite arm was performed. The following parameters were recorded: onset of maximum blockade, mean time of PTC stimulation, the maximum number of responses to PTC, time of the first and second TOF responses, and recovery profile until 90{\%} TOF ratio. RESULTS: Time to reach 90{\%} TOF recovery was similar on both arms (48 +/- 9 min), with a difference of 16 +/- 38 s between the arms (P = 0.64). The first and second responses of the TOF on the PTC-stimulated arm appeared at 29 +/- 8 min and 33 +/- 7 min, respectively. On the other arm the responses appeared at 30 +/- 8 min and 35 +/- 8 min, respectively (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Repetitive PTC stimulation every 3 min hastened the first and second responses of the TOF stimulation but we could not detect a significant difference in the 90{\%} recovery of TOF ratio during atracurium blockade.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many studies have indicated that acceleromyography and mechanomyography cannot be used interchangeably. To improve the agreement between the two methods, it has been suggested to use a preload and to refer all train-of-four (TOF) ratios to the control TOF (normalization) when using acceleromyography. The first purpose of this study was to test whether a preload applied to acceleromyography would increase the precision and the agreement with mechanomyography. The second purpose was to evaluate whether normalization would improve the agreement with mechanomyography. METHODS: Sixty patients were randomized to acceleromyography with or without a preload (Hand Adapter; Organon, Oss, the Netherlands). On the contralateral arm, mechanomyography was used. Anesthesia was induced with propofol and an opioid, and neuromuscular block with 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium. The precision and the bias and limits of agreement (with or without normalization) between the methods were evaluated using TOF stimulation. RESULTS: Preload improved the precision of acceleromyography by 21{\%}, but it also increased the mean control TOF ratio from 1.07 to 1.13. Normalization of the acceleromyographic TOF ratios diminished the bias to mechanomyography during recovery (e.g., from 0.15 to 0.05 at TOF 0.90); when the mechanomyographic TOF values were normalized as well, the bias was eliminated. However, normalization did not exclude wide individual differences between acceleromyography and mechanomyography (+/- 0.10-0.20 at TOF 0.90). CONCLUSION: Preload increases the precision of acceleromyography, and normalization of the TOF ratios decreases bias in relation to mechanomyography. When both acceleromyography and mechanomyography are normalized, there is no significant bias between the two methods.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to compare the infusion rates required to maintain a constant neuromuscular block and the reversibility of rocuronium at the corrugator supercilii muscle (CSM) and the adductor pollicis muscle (APM). METHODS: We randomly allocated 30 female patients into two groups of 15 patients each to monitor neuromuscular block at either the CSM or the APM. After induction of anaesthesia and laryngeal mask insertion, contraction of the CSM to the facial nerve stimulation or that of the APM to the ulnar nerve stimulation was quantified using an acceleromyograph during 1.0-1.5{\%} end-tidal sevoflurane anaesthesia. All the patients received a bolus of 1 mg/kg rocuronium. When the first twitch (T1) of train-of-four (TOF) recovered to 10{\%} of the control, rocuronium infusion was commenced and maintained at T1 of 10{\%} of the control at the CSM or APM for 120 min. Immediately after rocuronium infusion was discontinued, the time required for 0.04 mg/kg neostigmine-facilitated recovery to a TOF ratio of 0.9 was recorded. RESULTS: Rocuronium infusion dose after a lapse of 120 min was significantly larger in the CSM than in the APM {$[$}7.1 (2.3) vs. 4.7 (2.6) microg/kg/min; P=0.001{$]$}. The time for facilitated recovery was shorter in the CSM than in the APM {$[$}11.4 (3.8) vs. 16.2 (6.0) min; P=0.016{$]$}. CONCLUSION: A larger rocuronium infusion dose was required to maintain a constant neuromuscular block at the CSM. Neostigmine-mediated reversal was faster at the CSM.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acceleromyography has been shown to be an appropriate method in the detection of residual paralysis. However, the clinical importance of an individual calibration of the device in the single patient to improve reliability in detecting residual paralysis remains unclear. METHODS: Observational study in 100 patients undergoing general anaesthesia with endotracheal intubation and a neuromuscular block with atracurium. In all patients, an individually calibrated acceleromyograph was used to estimate a possible residual block at the end of surgery. Immediately after finishing the calibrated measurements at the end of surgery, a non-calibrated measurement was performed. Agreements between the two measurements were tested using Cohen's κand a Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS: Data from 96 patients were analysed. At the end of surgery, a discordance in the calibrated and the non-calibrated train-of-four ratio was found in 88 patients. Bland-Altman analysis showed a mean (bias) of 0.01, with limits of agreement of 0.15/-0.15. κwas calculated with κ=0.84 for the absence or presence of a potential residual block if defined as a train-of-four ratio of 1.0 as a threshold. CONCLUSIONS: The results imply a good agreement in the detection of the presence or absence of a residual neuromuscular block between calibrated and non-calibrated acceleromyography if a train-of-four ratio of 1.0 has been chosen as the threshold. However, the estimated train-of-four values are not transferable between calibrated and non-calibrated measurements.},

@article{Thilen:2012ti,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Residual paralysis is common after general anesthesia involving administration of neuromuscular blocking drugs (NMBDs). Management of NMBDs and reversal is frequently guided by train-of-four (TOF) monitoring. We hypothesized that monitoring of eye muscles is associated with more frequent residual paralysis than monitoring at the adductor pollicis. METHODS: This prospective cohort study enrolled 180 patients scheduled for elective surgery with anticipated use of NMBDs. Collected variables included monitoring site, age, gender, weight, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class, type and duration of surgery, type of NMBDs, last and total dose administered, TOF count at time of reversal, dose of neostigmine, and time interval between last dose of NMBDs to quantitative measurement. Upon postanesthesia care unit admission, we measured TOF ratios by acceleromyography at the adductor pollicis. Residual paralysis was defined as a TOF ratio less than 90{\%}. Multivariable logistic regression was used to account for unbalances between the two groups and to adjust for covariates. RESULTS: 150 patients received NMBDs and were included in the analysis. Patients with intraoperative TOF monitoring of eye muscles had significantly greater incidence of residual paralysis than patients monitored at the adductor pollicis (P < 0.01). Residual paralysis was observed in 51/99 (52{\%}) and 11/51 (22{\%}) of patients, respectively. The crude odds ratio was 3.9 (95{\%} CI: 1.8-8.4), and the adjusted odds ratio was 5.5 (95{\%} CI: 2.1-14.5). CONCLUSIONS: Patients having qualitative TOF monitoring of eye muscles had a greater than 5-fold higher risk of postoperative residual paralysis than those monitored at the adductor pollicis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neuromuscular monitoring using the corrugator supercilii muscle is associated with a number of challenges. The aim of this study was to assess reversal of a rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade with sugammadex according to monitoring either using the corrugator supercilii muscle or the adductor pollicis muscle. We hypothesized that a larger dose of sugammadex would be required to obtain a train-of-four (TOF) ratio of 1.0 with the corrugator supercilii muscle than with the adductor pollicis muscle. METHODS: Forty patients aged 20-60 years and 40 patients aged ≥70 years were enrolled. After induction of anesthesia, we recorded the corrugator supercilii muscle response to facial nerve stimulation and the adductor pollicis muscle response to ulnar nerve stimulation using acceleromyography. All patients received 1 mg/kg rocuronium. When the first twitch (T1) of TOF recovered to 10{\%} of control values at the corrugator supercilii, rocuronium infusion was commenced to maintain a T1 of 10{\%} of the control at the corrugator supercilii. Immediately after discontinuation of rocuronium infusion, 2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg of sugammadex was administered. The time for recovery to a TOF ratio of 1.0 and the number of patients not reaching a TOF ratio of 1.0 by 5 min at each dose and muscle was recorded. RESULTS: When neuromuscular block at the corrugator supercilii was maintained at a T1 of 10{\%} of control, that at the adductor pollicis was deep (post-tetanic count ≤5). Sugammadex 4 mg/kg completely antagonized neuromuscular block at both muscles within 5 min. The time to a TOF ratio of 1.0 at the adductor pollicis was significantly longer in the group ≥70 years than the group 20-60 years (mean (SD): 178 (42.8) s vs. 120 (9.4) s, P < 0.0001). In contrast, 2 mg/kg sugammadex reversed neuromuscular blockade at the corrugator supercilii but not at the adductor pollicis, with 10 patients in the group 20-60 years and 8 patients in the group ≥70 years requiring an additional sugammadex (P < 0.05 vs. 4 mg/kg sugammadex). CONCLUSION: Sugammadex 4 mg/kg was required to reverse a moderate rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block when the corrugator supercilii muscle is used for monitoring.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to characterize the dose-effect relationship of rocuronium at the adductor pollicis and masseter muscles. METHODS: Ten, ASA I, adult patients, received a bolus dose of rocuronium 0.3 mg/kg during propofol based anesthesia. Train-of-four (TOF) was simultaneously monitored at the masseter and the adductor pollicis muscles until recovery. Rocuronium arterial serum concentrations were measured during 120 min. The first twitch of the TOF response was used to characterize the time-effect profile of both muscles using pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis in NONMEM. A decrease in NONMEM objective function (∆OFV) of 3.84 points for an added parameter was considered significant at the 0.05 level. RESULTS: Onset time at the masseter (mean $\pm$SD, 1.5 $\pm$0.9 min) was faster than at the adductor pollicis (2.7 $\pm$1.4 min, P < 0.05). Recovery, measured as the time to TOF ratio = 0.9 was similar between muscles 29.9 $\pm$6.7 (adductor pollicis) vs. 29.3 $\pm$8.1 (masseter). (P = 0.77). The estimated pharmacodynamic parameters {$[$}mean (95{\%} CI){$]$} of the adductor pollicis muscle and the masseter muscle were; plasma effect-site equilibration half-time (teq) 3.25 (2.34, 3.69) min vs. 2.86 (1.83, 3.29) min, (∆OFV 383.665); Ce50 of 1.24 (1.13, 1.56) mg/l vs. 1.19 (1.00, 1.21) mg/l, (∆OFV 184.284); Hill coefficient of 3.97 (3.82, 5.62) vs. 4.68 (3.83, 5.71), (∆OFV 78.906). CONCLUSIONS: We found that the masseter muscle has faster onset of blockade and similar recovery profile than adductor pollicis muscle.

	abstract = {During neuromuscular monitoring, repeated electrical stimulation evokes muscle responses of increasing magnitude ('staircase phenomenon', SP). We aimed to evaluate whether SP affects time course and twitches' values of an acceleromyographic assessed neuromuscular block with or without previous tetanic stimulation. Fifty adult patients were randomized to receive a 50 Hz tetanic stimulus (S group) or not (C group) before monitor calibration. After 20 min of TOF ratio (TOFr) stimulation rocuronium was administered. Onset time of block (primary endpoint), recovery of T1 to 25{\%}, TOFr to 0.9, and recovery index were compared. We also compared T1 and TOFr at baseline, post-stimulation, and during recovery from block. Moreover the correlation between T1 at maximum recovery and (a) baseline T1 and (b) post-stimulation T1 along with T1/TOFr ratio during recovery were evaluated. After stimulation median T1 increased (32{\%}) in group C and decreased (16{\%}) in group S (P = 0.0001). Onset time (Median {$[$}IQR{$]$} in seconds) was 90 (29-77) vs. 75 (28-60) in C and S group (P = 0.002). Time {$[$}Mean (SD) in minutes{$]$} to normalized TOFr 0.9 were 70.13 (14.9) vs. 62.1 (21.2) in C and S groups (P = 0.204). TOFr showed no differences between groups at any time point. T1 at maximum recovery showed a stronger correlation with post-stabilization T1 compared to baseline. (ρ= 0.80 and ρ= 0.85, for C and S groups.) Standard calibration does not ensure twitch baseline stabilization and prolongs onset time of neuromuscular block. TOF ratio is not influenced by SP.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neuromuscular blockade (NMB) monitoring is essential to avoid residual NMB. While the adductor pollicis is the recommended site for monitoring recovery, it is not always accessible. The flexor hallucis brevis could be an interesting alternative. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to compare NMB onset and recovery at both sites. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Operating rooms at the University Hospital of Poitiers, France. PATIENTS: Sixty patients scheduled for surgery under general anaesthesia with neuromuscular blocking agents were enrolled from January 2016 to September 2017. Data from 56 patients were finally analysed. Among these, 11 patients received pharmacological reversal with neostigmine and atropine before emergence from anaesthesia. INTERVENTION: After atracurium injection, NMB onset and recovery at the adductor pollicis and flexor hallucis brevis were monitored simultaneously. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The time to NMB onset, defined as a train-of-four (TOF) count equal to 0, and the times to NMB recovery: TOF = 1, TOF = 4, T4/T1 ratio = 0.75 and T4/T1 ratio more than 0.90. RESULTS: NMB onset was significantly slower at the flexor hallucis brevis with a mean onset time of 4.4 $\pm$1.5 versus 3.7 $\pm$1.2 min at adductor pollicis (P = 0.0001). Recovery to TOF = 1 was significantly slower at flexor hallucis brevis. No difference was found for TOF = 4. The full recovery of NMB (T4/T1 > 0.90) was significantly faster at flexor hallucis brevis with a mean time to recovery of 59.5 $\pm$9.9 versus 64.5 $\pm$10.7 min at adductor pollicis (P < 0.0001), a difference of 4.9 min between both sites. This difference was not present after pharmacological reversal with a mean time to recovery of 53.0 $\pm$12.2 min at flexor hallucis brevis versus 54.0 $\pm$12.4 min at adductor pollicis (P = 0.28). However, NMB onset and recovery did not follow the same pattern in individual patients. CONCLUSION: Flexor hallucis brevis could be an interesting alternative site for NMB monitoring when the adductor pollicis is not accessible. However, in the absence of pharmacological reversal, monitoring at the hallucis brevis muscle should be used with caution for the detection of residual paralysis.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported an association between the use of neuromuscular blocking (NMB) agents and postoperative pulmonary complications. Postoperative pulmonary function is a key indicator for postoperative pulmonary complications. Several sites can be used to assess depth and recovery from NMB. OBJECTIVES: To investigate postoperative pulmonary function change in relation to train-of-four measurements at the adductor pollicis and corrugator supercilii muscles, and anaesthesia-related variables in orthopaedic patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENTS: Orthopaedic patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Postoperative pulmonary function tests in the postanaesthesia care unit. METHODS: Patients scheduled for elective hip or knee arthroplasty received simultaneous corrugator supercilii and adductor pollicis measurements during anaesthesia conducted according to clinical standards. Forced expiratory volume in 1 s and forced vital capacity (FVC) were measured at the time of inclusion and postoperatively on the postanaesthesia care unit. Linear regression analysis was performed for association between risk factors and pulmonary function change. RESULTS: A total of 35 patients were included. After exclusions, 20 patients remained for final analysis. Corrugator supercilii showed earlier NMB recovery than adductor pollicis. FVC decreased significantly after surgery from 2.9 $\pm$1.0 to 2.3 $\pm$1.0 (P < 0.01) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s decreased from 2.3 $\pm$0.9 to 1.6 $\pm$0.8 l (P < 0.01). Patient age was the only factor significantly related to FVC decrease after surgery (P = 0.019) with a cut-off value of 65 years. CONCLUSION: Both corrugator supercilii and adductor pollicis failed to indicate recovery of pulmonary function after NMB. Age seems to be a risk factor for postoperative decline in pulmonary function. TRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical Trials registry, DRKS-ID: DRKS00014305.},

@article{Eriksson:1991ve,
	abstract = {In eight healthy patients, the influence of the train-of-four (TOF) response of prolonged neuromuscular monitoring and of different peripheral temperatures was studied during normal core temperature. Anaesthesia was induced and maintained with midazolam-fentanyl and a 70/30{\%} mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen. The mechanical TOF response of the adductor pollicis muscle (twitch tension and TOF ratio), was recorded simultaneously in both hands using supramaximal TOF stimulation of the ulnar nerve at the wrist. One arm was kept normothermic. The other arm was cooled using cold infusions and cold packings. Skin, muscle and core temperatures were continuously measured. In the normothermic arm (skin temperature > 32.0$\,^{\circ}$C), the twitch tension and TOF ratio were unchanged following 130-230 min of continuous nerve stimulation. In the hypothermic arm the twitch tension and TOF ratio showed only minor variations above a skin temperature of 32.0$\,^{\circ}$C (corresponding to a mean muscle temperature of 34.5 $\pm$0.3$\,^{\circ}$C). Below a skin temperature of 32.0$\,^{\circ}$C a progressive decrease in TOF response was recorded. A linear relationship was found between skin temperature and TOF response as well as between muscle temperature and TOF response. At a skin temperature of 27.0$\,^{\circ}$C (corresponding to a mean muscle temperature of 30.8 $\pm$0.4$\,^{\circ}$C), an approximate 20{\%} reduction in twitch tension and a 10{\%} decrease in TOF ratio were recorded with a considerable interindividual variation. We conclude that prolonged TOF nerve stimulation does not change the mechanical twitch respense in patients with a normal central and peripheral temperature. A peripheral skin temperature below 32.0$\,^{\circ}$C with sustained and normal body temperature is, however, associated with changes in both twitch tension and TOF ratio that may be a source of error when evaluating neuromuscular function.},

@article{Sugi:2013vq,
	abstract = {Purpose: Recovery of the train-of-four ratio (TOFR) to > 0.9 in the upper limb is commonly used to determine that neuromuscular function has returned to the preoperative level. It is not known whether recovery of neuromuscular function can be determined in the same way using lower limb acceleromyography. We compared measurements of recovery from neuromuscular blockade using upper limb electromyography and lower limb acceleromyography. Methods: Twenty-nine patients who were scheduled for elective surgery were enrolled in this study. Patients were excluded if they had neuromuscular disease or contraindications to neuromuscular blockade. General anesthesia was induced and maintained with propofol and fentanyl. Patients were monitored using electromyography at the first dorsal interosse-ous muscle of the upper limb and acceleromyography at the flexor hallucis brevis muscle of the lower limb. Vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg was administered for neuromuscular blockade, and the profile of the blockade was recorded, including onset time and recovery times to TOFR 0.7 and 0.9. Results were compared between the upper and lower limbs. Results: The first dorsal interosseous muscle of the upper limb was slower to recover to TOFR 0.7 and 0.9 than the flexor hallucis brevis muscle. When the TOFR at the flexor hallucis brevis muscle had recovered to 0.9, the TOFR at the first dorsal interosseous muscle was 0.44 $\pm$0.23. Conclusion: Monitoring the flexor hallucis brevis muscle using acceleromyography underestimates the residual neuro-muscular blockade. {\copyright}Sugi et al.; Licensee Bentham Open.},

	abstract = {ABS TRACT Objective: The aim of the study was to investigate the incidence of postoperative residual curarization (PORC) after rocuronium administration using normalized acceleromyographic (AMG) train-of-four (TOF) ratios. Material and Met hods: During propofol-fentanyl- nitrous oxide anesthesia, neuromuscular block was monitored using acceleromyography method in 130 patients. A TOF ratio measured at the end of control stimulation was recorded as a baseline TOF value. Neuromuscular block was induced with rocuronium 0.6 mg.kg-1 and antagonized with neostigmine 40 μg.kg-1 at the end of anesthesia. Immediately after the patients' arrival in the postanesthetic care unit (PACU), TOF ratios were measured and normalized (i.e., dividing the raw TOF ratio by the baseline TOF value). The incidences of PORC were determined according to three different TOF threshold values: Normalized AMG-TOF ratio <1; raw AMG-TOF ratio <1; and raw AMG-TOF ratio < 0.9. Re sults: The baseline AMG TOF ratios varied widely 110.8 (91-149) among patients. Considering normalized AMG-TOF ratios <1 as PORC, 77 (63.1%) patients had PORC on arrival to the PACU. Significantly fewer patients had raw TOF ratios < 0.9 (39 subjects, 31.9%), and <1 (67 subjects, 54.9%) than whose normalized TOF ratios <1 (77 subjects, 63.1 %) (p< 0.05). Although not statistically significant, the when it was determined using normalized AMG-TOF ratios rather than using raw AMG-TOF ratios (18.3% and 10%, respectively). Conc lu si on: Despite reversal of neuromuscular block with neostigmine, the incidence of PORC is very high after rocuronium administration.},
